It seems I am again in a bit of trouble. Wait, before you go jumping to conclusions, I swear, this time it is not my fault. I used to belong to this organization, the problem is this organization has refused to accept my resignation. I guess certain people cannot live without my skills. This is understandable as I am very good at what I do. I just prefer to work without a plasma turret pointed at my head. I am sure you understand.

Now, I know what you are thinking. The last time you helped me you got a little more than you bargained for. Things worked out in the end though, right? Help me again and I will make it worth your while. Trust me.

"RE: Secret Grineer Colony.

How do we hide it? The Tenno, with their eyeless slag, will squeeze it from our Scouts! They already know our methods from their Capture missions. Data-viruses distributed among our flock will not hold them off. Hiding the Grineer base and collecting our fees requires escalation.

My plan is simple. Gather our Scouts and Navigators and launch them in to the Void. This has two benefits: the Betrayers will be hard-pressed to assemble the coordinate data and if they do, they will place themselves at great risk aboard a conventional craft within the Void's storm.

If the board approves I will divide our flock into three groups and begin. It pains me to help the Dogs in this way, but as always, profit numbs the feeling.

They found us. Why did the Corpus think they could hide in the Void? Despite their heritage they seem blind to the Tenno's connection to that place. I know you are sour on mysticism but I'm beginning to turn my view on it.

Every time we tear a Tenno corpse from its metal womb we find nothing to explain their power. Our Warframe engineers gesture wildly about nanotechnology, how reactive dissolution hides the answers. What if a Warframe is merely a lightning rod? A conduit for these demons of the Void? Consider how it could change our plan.

For now I await the Tenno's invasion of our Settlements. I have brought with me some reinforcements and your messages of encouragement to rile up the troops.

They struck during the night cycle. I woke to hear the massive thunder of one of their anchor mines tearing into our hull, then screaming. They tore through our security like they weren't there. Every one of them as big as the biggest man I've ever seen.  I never seen anything like it.

Those of us who survived the initial strike were captured and taken to the loading bay. We thought maybe they'll hold us here for ransom. We were so naive. That's when he came in. They said his name was Captain Vor, he was even bigger than the others and even they seemed to fear him. For reasons I will never know, he picked me out of the crowd. I was taken to the command room and told to watch. I wasn't prepared for what came next.

They just opened the external bay doors. Everyone single one of those people, hundreds of men, women and children disappeared in an instant. Sucked out into nothingness. Then, just as quickly, they took placed me in an escape pod.

NAME - Check the Codex for a list of what is possible!

DRAIN - This is the capacity cost for equipping this Mod.

POLARITY - In the upgrade screen you will see that Mod Slots will often be attuned to a specific Polarity. Matching Mods to Slot Polarities significantly reduce the drain, while Mods that do not match will increase the drain.

FUSION - You can increase the level of a Mod through Fusion. This will increase both its effectiveness and drain.

CONCLAVE - This value contributes to your overall Conclave rating. This limits which Player vs. Player Conclaves you may fight in.

ITEM - This determines the type of item this Mod can be installed in. It may refer to a broad range of weapon types or a specific weapon.

UPGRADE - Describes the effect this Mod has on your item. Statistical benefits will rise if you apply Fusion to the Mod.

RARITY - Rarity is identified by the color of the frame on the Mod. Golden Mods are the rarest kind, Silver Mods are uncommon and Bronze Mods are the most common variety."

[/Lotus/Language/Archive/ModsTrainingPt4]
"DRAIN
Each mod has a value attributed to Drain, which indicates the capacity cost to equip the mod onto your weapons or Warframe. 

As your gear increases in power, your mod capacity also increases, allowing you to equip additional mods to your loadout.

POLARITY
Warframe and weapon mod slots are sometimes attuned to a specific polarity, which is visible in the Upgrade screen of the Arsenal. 

On the mod upgrade, polarity is indicated by a symbol next to the Drain amount. Matching mods to slots with the same polarity will reduce the drain amount, while mods that do not match slot polarity will increase the drain.

FUSION 
Collecting a Mod is just the first step. All Mods can be upgraded through a process called Endo Fusion. Endo, a fusion energy, reacts with Mods to increase their rank, giving you more power! 

To acquire the Mod fusion energy known as 'Endo', you can dissolve Duplicate Mods into Endo, play missions for Endo drops, and more!"

"PLAN YOUR PATH

When a Tenno has learned enough, they begin to bend the rules of the system by augmenting their gear with Orokin technology...

Orokin Catalysts and Reactors increase the Mod capacity of Weapons and Warframes respectively.

Forma allows a Tenno to modify the polarity of a Mod slot in their item. In this way they optimize their Mod configuration for even greater power.

Auras are special Warframe Mods, designed to help your entire team and actually boost your Mod capacity!

To reach perfection, a Tenno must meditate on the depths of the Mods system."

"Our incursions into The Void have proven that Orokin ships are full of powerful secrets. The Orokin Derelict ships, the ones that could not escape into the Void, are no different. 

Hidden deep within the hulls of The Derelicts, the Orokin created Vaults to seal away their treasures.

As The Derelicts were explored, four different types of Vaults were found. And after much trial and error, a way was found to break them open. 

By using Ferrite to corrupt the keys that grant access to The Void, ‘Vault keys’ were forged. They are a burden to carry, and no single Tenno can bear more than one. Such is the risk of attempting entry. 

The danger within the Orokin Vaults may be greater still... but their secrets must be revealed.

[/Lotus/Language/Archive/SlingStoneBody]
"We have just learned that the Grineer Empire is preparing a major offensive against the Corpus. The Sisters have grown impatient with the Corpus monopoly on manufacturing supplies. Their aim is to destroy resource stockpiles throughout Corpus space in order to force the arrogant Corpus back to the bargaining table. The Grineer are deploying new FOMORIAN class ships, poised to strike the Corpus within days.

As much as we'd like to see the Corpus suffer we cannot allow such a growth in Grineer influence to go unchecked. We must work together to destroy the Fomorian ships as they appear or we will suffer resource shortages that will curtail our war effort. We must uphold the balance of this conflict.

Tenno, you must coordinate your attacks - their engineers will be repairing these ships throughout our assault. This is not a standard sabotage mission. You will need to inject a chemical agent harvested from the Infestation to destabilize the Fomorian reactors. With enough corruption the Fomorian reactors will implode and take the monstrous ship with it."

I'm proud to report that Sling-Stone was a success! The Fomorian ships have been reduced to radioactive scraps drifting through the system... 

The Betrayers did our work for us. Billions saved in potential damages. I just dangled some Mod technology in front of their noses and let their homicidal nature do the rest. Too easy!

The Grineer have returned to the bargaining table but something in their tone irks me. I've dispatched scouts to Pluto - I suspect the Grineer may have held a few Fomorians in reserve.

"Dark Sectors"

[/Lotus/Language/Archive/SolarRailTrainingPt1]
"Solar Rails are colossal Orokin devices that distort the Void and allow players to reach otherwise inaccessible regions of space, known as Dark Sectors. Clans and Alliances can deploy Solar Rails to control these areas on the Solar Map, collecting tributes from players who access areas within their territory."

[/Lotus/Language/Archive/SolarRailTrainingPt2]
"Once an Oracle has been built, Clans are able to construct Orokin Labs in their Dojos. Clan Warlords and Tacticians can research blueprints and construct Solar Rails from the terminals located inside the Orokin Lab. Small clans can unite to form Alliances, and are able to construct an Alliance Solar Rail. All clans within the Alliance may contribute toward the research and construction of the Solar Rail."

[/Lotus/Language/Archive/SolarRailTrainingPt3]
"Researching a Solar Rail blueprint requires resource contributions from clan members. The resources required scales with the size of the Clan. Once research is complete, construction on the Solar Rail can begin. The resource requirements of a Solar Rail however, do not scale with the size of the clan, so it is imperative for small clans to form an Alliance to expedite the construction process.

A schema is required to be applied to a Solar Rail before it can be deployed. The schemas can be accessed independently from the Solar Rails via one of the consoles near the entrance to the Orokin Lab. From this console you can design the layout of your Solar Rail.

Tacticians and Warlords will be able to build the rooms and place defense systems within the schema, while other clan members will be able to contribute to their cost. The schema is complete once the Power Core room has been constructed. It can then be applied to Solar Rail that is ready to be deployed, or can override an existing Solar Rail's layout."

[/Lotus/Language/Archive/SolarRailTrainingPt4]
"Once construction has been completed, clans and Alliances are able to deploy their Solar Rails on specified Dark Sectors of the Solar Map. The Clan or Alliance controlling the Solar Rail will be able to specify a tribute, collecting a percentage of any resources or credits collected by players using the Solar Rail."

[/Lotus/Language/Archive/SolarRailTrainingPt5]
"If another clan already controls a Dark Sector, ownership can be contested by deploying a Solar Rail into their territory. Deploying a second Solar Rail within close proximity of another causes interference with the Void-Disruption Technology used to reach the Dark Sectors. This prevents other Tenno from accessing these regions of space while both Solar Rails are active.

When conflict over Solar Rails controlled by rival Clans or Alliances arises, Tenno have the opportunity to fight for either side by undertaking missions. Missions played for one side cause damage to the opposing Solar Rail. Clans may offer Battle Pay to those who side with them to gain additional support."

[/Lotus/Language/Archive/SolarRailTrainingPt6]
"Those supporting the challenger will attack the solar rail, while those supporting the defender will try and stop them. All battles take place in the Defending Solar Rail as designed by the defending clan.

The Mods used by Tenno and equipped on their weapons will initially be locked. As you gain experience by defeating the forces on the opposing side, your Mods will unlock allowing you to become more powerful as the battle progresses. The goal is to destroy the Power Core if you are supporting the Challenger, or defend it if you are supporting the Defenders.

Each victory for the Challenger will damage the Defending Solar Rail. It is destroyed if its health reaches zero before the timer expires. There can be only one rail on a node, if the Defending Solar Rail survives the challenge, then the Challenging Solar Rail will succumb to energy interference and implode."

[/Lotus/Language/Archive/SynthesisTrainingPt1]
"Cephalon Simaris is building a digital oasis called Sanctuary. Simaris requires Tenno to hunt down and ‘convert’ special targets in a process called ‘Synthesis’. In exchange, Simaris promises enlightenment to his hunters.

Visit him in a Relay to learn which type of target he is interested in collecting. Over time, Simaris will choose new targets for the Sanctuary.

The tools of the hunt are your Synthesis Scanner and Kinetic Siphon gear. Equip these before embarking on your missions. Hunt where the target is normally found, avoiding closed mission types like Defense and Interception."

[/Lotus/Language/Archive/SynthesisTrainingPt2]
"Simaris will inform you if he detects a Synthesis target in your mission area. Now the hunt begins! Equip your Synthesis Scanner and track the faint glowing signatures to its hiding spot.

Upon reaching the target you will use the Synthesis Scanner to analyze specific points on it. But beware! The Synthesis causes dangerous side-effects, increasingly adding risk to completing the Synthesis.

If the target is aware of you it may attack or try to escape. This will make scanning its points especially difficult. Effective Tenno will often deploy Kinetic Siphons to temporarily immobilize the target to complete their hunt.

Are you ready for the hunt, Tenno?"

[/Lotus/Language/Archive/VorLore]
"MY QUEENS -

You were right, the Tenno threat is real. We found one drifting near Pluto but the Lotus knew we were coming. She purged the Cryo moments before we had them and sent a squad of Tenno to break our assault.

They escaped. We are working on tracing them. Separate this Tenno from the flock and it should be easy to kill. We shattered its Warframe and expect such an abrupt Cryo purge will have damaged its memories.

We anxiously await punishment for failing this task.

Salvage like this is worth more than water, but Dad said we weren't going to touch a thing. Made me swear to forget we ever saw it.

They say these chambers are just tombs for 'Tenno'. Just dead soldiers from the war before. Buried in their Warframe armor. When I pushed my face against the glass I felt something. I didn't say anything to Dad though, Tenno are just magic and fantasy. False hope.

Things are getting desperate with the Grineer army now. If I had one wish, it'd be that the Tenno were real. For my part, I'm going to make sure the Grineer never find this place. I wiped the coordinates from the log - we'll have to look elsewhere for Rubedo.

Sargas Ruk claims to be a self-made man. He rose from humble beginnings as a Grineer Freighter hand to the rank of Fleet Minister. Ruk's appointment was a surprise to those that knew him. He had little education, a 'denied' reproduction rating, and one of the lowest intellect scores seen in ambulatory Grineer. Yet, Ruk has an uncanny ability to influence those around him - incredible given his speech is nearly incomprehensible (he has an enormous tongue deformity).

Perhaps Ruk's inexplicable rise to power has its origins in his humbler days. He worked Orokin recovery missions for the fleet. Ruk's detractors insist he has Orokin technology that weakens will. To date, 100% of these accusations have been withdrawn.

Now that you have freed yourself from Vor and his Ascaris, you have a new mission, one of your own making. Know that I am only your guide, you are your own warrior, you decide what battles to fight. Allow me to suggest a course of action: 

Seek out like-minded fighters, Tenno are more effective in groups. 

Execute missions and alerts on the Star Chart to open new paths of exploration. 

Use the credits you earned in battle to buy blueprints in the Market, then hunt down resources and craft those items in your Foundry. 

Customize your weapons and Warframes using the Mod bench. Different enemies are vulnerable to different combinations of mods, experiment to discover the most effective loadouts. 

Finally, stay alert. The Grineer and Corpus are tireless and you are the only thing standing between them and total domination of the Origin System. 

I am counting on you Tenno.

"Three figures waited behind a simple table. Their attention on a single chair, bathed in light. An old woman’s voice from the shadow: 'Send her in'. Across the room a security officer, stern and plain, opened the door. The outline of a young woman appeared at the door. She hesitated, but only for an instant, then crossed the room and sat.

There was a gasp as the light hit her face. Her right eye was bright and blinking, but her left was a greasy slit. Her skin had been burned moon-white. Her mouth was a sagging gash without lips or expression. Her military beret was pulled snug over a scarred and hairless scalp.

The old voice: 'Your name is Kaleen.' Kaleen nodded. 'You were the principal investigator of the Zariman?' Kaleen’s voice was a jagged whisper, a rigid face. 'Yes.'

Kaleen coughed, straightened: 'The Zariman was lost making the fold from Saturn to the Outer gates. Mechanical failure. I notified families and filed a report with the inspectors. Nothing ever returns from the fold, so I closed the case.'

'But you reopened the case, days later.'

'I didn’t believe it myself until I stepped aboard the ship. It was completely intact, full environmental, as if it had never left.'

'And the crew was gone.'

'Not exactly.' Kaleen hesitated. 'We thought it was empty but we began to find...' Her face twitched at remembered pain, 'We began to find children hiding in the ship.'

'And that is when you violated procedure?'

Kaleen bowed her head, a tear welling in her sightless eye. 'They were children. They were afraid. They needed comfort.'

'So you broke quarantine and this happened to you.'

There was silence as Kaleen touched her face, 'So what have you done with them?'

The old woman gestured for the officer to take Kaleen away. The meeting was over. When Kaleen reached the door she twisted out of his grip and shot back, 'Why would you do that? Why would you put children on a military ship?'

'We didn’t. That would violate procedure.'"

"The Sentients had won. They had turned our weapons, our technology, against us. The more advanced we became, the greater our losses. The war was over unless we found a new way. In our desperation we turned to the Void. The blinding night, the hellspace where our science and reason failed.

We took the twisted few that had returned from that place. We built a frame around them, a conduit of their affliction. Gave them the weapons of the old ways. Gun and blade. A new warrior, a new code was born. These rejects, these Tenno, became our saviors. Warrior-Gods cast in steel and fury striking our enemies in a way they could never comprehend.

Excalibur was the first.

[/Lotus/Language/Codex/MagPrimeLongDesc]
"Warframe Archive - Debrief excerpt:

We sat strapped in, safeties off, waiting for the punch. Waiting for death. Through my filthy porthole I saw stars among the outlines of the other Splinter ships queuing for the Solar Rail. It would soon grip us with an incomprehensible power and cast us through the void into the mouth of our enemy.

I watched the ships one-by-one bending and gone. Each crammed with zero-tech soldiers sucking stale air, white knuckling their percussion rifles. Each filled with a desperation that comes from extinction. Our ship would be the last to cross the gap. Our ship had special cargo.

It was essentially empty. Just ten men, like me, strapped in with the best zero-tech suits and weapons the empire could build... and "it". "It" stood in the aisle, a slender and eyeless metal form. A Tenno inside its Warframe. Vaguely human, vaguely feminine. Was this armor or some ornate carapace for the monster that lived inside? I strained against the harness as the ship yawed for final approach. I could see the Tenno standing there freely. Solemn and gold-gleaming, oblivious to the inertial force.

I had been, until then, a Tenno denier. They were ghosts, propaganda, twisted casualties of the void era. Not possibly real. Yet here it was in the flesh. The Empire, in their desperation, was going to turn the demons loose and hope for the best. Who did we fear more, the enemy or this monster? We had our safeties off, could we trust it? Then it didn’t matter anymore. The punch came - and our windows became blinding. When we could see again our ship was somewhere else, shattered and dead in an instant.

My lungs were flattened, eyes full of death. Ship debris glittered like a night snow. The alien blue star   was dark and blinding beyond us. The countless articulating worm-ships of our enemy, ringed in glowing discs, undulating and heat-bursting the surviving soldiers like me. This is where I died. I was caught in R-disc, sweeping over my right side and setting my blood on fire. My vision flattened, the hearing muffled and buzzed. I could feel the side of my face going slack and wet.

I was in a dying dream. I saw a bright spot blurring and weaving toward me. I felt a tug toward it from the metal clasps on my suit. It reached me, rising up - a gleaming metal beast, a plume of golden wings rising and unfolding behind it. An angel. It snatched me from my death. I could feel my lungs fill as it wrapped me in its wings. Its Void Shield shimmered blue, strained under the enemy beams. I felt a sudden tug of acceleration. I closed my eyes and held on like a child.

I awoke on the floor, the sting of crisping flesh on my face and side. It was standing over me, the wings gone. I heard the cracking of weapons echoing down the corridor. Maybe the mission would be saved, but I was dying and so I waved my hand to send it away. I felt a pistol thrust in my hand as I was heaved to my feet. The angel had saved me, pulled me from hell, but it would not pity me. I was to die on my feet, by its side. I turned my good side toward the gunfire and raised the gun. It nodded, its outstretched metal hand surging and pulsing in ancient shapes as blue shimmered around me. It turned, drawing its blade and together we surged headlong into the hailstorm of death and fire that awaited us."

"Red lights flashing on stark, white walls. Davis is running ahead of me, dropping his notes. We’re running for our lives. The fear gives me a strange perspective - I’m out of my body. I’ve forgotten how I got here. I don’t recognize this place.

Davis and I slam pinned against a cell door and he shouts at me. I give him a dumb look. I can’t hear him, the sirens, anything, only the muffled throb of terror in my head. I turn away from Davis down the hall and I see it. The hulking mass, flickering red, glinting like steel and fresh blood. Its skin changes, flowing like mercury when I’m blinded by the sudden muzzle-flashes. They do no good. The beast surges forward and the security men become crimson mist and gore.

I’m a statue, a cornered animal. A gate opens inside me and recognition floods in. I have seen this monster before. I have cut its shell and eviscerated its brothers. I have given it pain and measured its response. I have crafted then rejected countless like it. But I’ve never seen this beast so close, without the shield, without restraints.  I have never seen it... free.

I know I will die so I just watch with curious acceptance. The beast squats down, shovelling a heap of gore into its mouth. It is watching me with vague eyes, a sense of recognition, ancestral memory. It knows who I am and what I’ve done.  It rears up like a bear and roars, shattering the lights and casting us into darkness. I can hear it lumbering toward me, its metal fingers rending the walls, but I know I am dead. I close my eyes and stand ready to pay.

I feel the pull on my arm and realize Davis got the cell open. He tugs me into the cell beyond and I fall on my back. I see Davis standing at the open door, waiting, as the monster tears towards us.

Suddenly I could live through this so I shout, "Davis, close the goddamn door!" - But he shakes his head with eyes wide as moons. He shouts, "Watch!" over the roaring and rending of metal.

Then silence. Davis is panting, laughing? The beast fills the doorway, inches from him, dripping in blood, but still without violence. It stands there, looking at its hands. Davis whispers, "No one would have believed me."

I crawl up the wall to stand, opposite the door. I’ve never seen this cell, a cold place with an array of shelves. A morgue? "Where are we, Davis?"

"This is where they keep them. The ones from Zariman." I’m thrown, what was the Zariman? The ship that never returned? "Davis, what’s going on?"

Davis turns to me a smile forming - "What's going on is..." he turns back to the beast now silent and calm. "...big, fat promotions.""

"Most Honored Councilor Vay Hek,

The agony treatment has worked! Tests show aggression has been shifted to The Tenno. The Grustrag Three are now ready for release and are eager for your orders.

Please note: fratricide is still an issue. Conditioning did not completely remove violent tendencies toward fellow Grineer. My solution is the Grustrag Bolt. When attached to a subject, this device limits combat effectiveness against all Grineer personnel. The bolt will ensure collateral death is acceptably limited. 

I have produced a surplus of these devices. Perhaps these will also aid you with your problem?

"Some have walked these desolate worlds while you slept. Some like me. I remember what you did. I remember the day.

The Tenno appeared at the Terminus, gleaming and victorious. Our cold and gold Emperors, breathless, bathed you in savior's silk. Then came the sound. Across all our worlds, all at once, the ceremonial Naga drums. A royal salute to the honored Tenno. Ten solemn beats to declare the suffering was over. I watched from a distance, with the rest of the low Guardians. With each beat terror began to crush my throat. The Tenno were not stoic and silent. They were waiting. They were poised. I tried to call out but only a strangled whisper escaped.

When the ninth beat rang a torrent of blood filled the stadium, loosed by Tenno blades. The drums, the Empire, fell silent forever.

Now I hunt, dividing your numbers. Watching from that dark place, cataloging your sins, I am the ghost of retribution. You may forget but you are not innocent."

Inmate Report: Vem Tabook

Vem Tabook, leader of 'The Grustrag Three', was committed after the group slaughtered all fellow marines aboard a troop transport. Evidently, the ship took too long to reach battle and the subject was simply "impatient for the killing". Like his accomplices Shik Tal and Leekter, Tabook suffers from a rare cloning mutation. This makes him highly effective in combat but completely unfit for duty.

RECOMMENDATION: Permanent incarceration for study. The subject's combat ability cannot be ignored.  If the subject’s aggression can be focused, he may yet prove a useful weapon.

Before you go, you should know something; the crew is Grineer. But not just any Grineer, they’re Kavor Defectors, pacifists who deserted Sargas Ruk’s army when they could no longer bring themselves to kill for him. They don’t want to fight anymore, not for the Grineer, and not for Steel Meridian. All they desire is a peaceful life, but that won’t come easy; Sargas Ruk is hot on their trail and desperate to make an example of them.

The Kavor need evacuation, will you answer this call?

For me, Alad V is a con and an imposter. Still, if Zanuka is brought to full production he will become the richest and most powerful member of the Corpus Board. He could become Chairman. That is my problem. 

I have sent my forces to Jupiter to capture the criminal but Alad is using that damned infestation as a biological weapon. Every last ship has been overrun by those monsters. This is now your problem. Wipe those ships clean and I will reveal Alad V's location. With that information, you can make the rest of our problems go away. Deal?

You see, I have an appetite for the rare and extraordinary and I’ve recently learned of a fine substance known as Cryotic. If you are willing, I will supply the necessary equipment and coordinates for its extraction. We can even split the spoils, I only require half of all cryotic you acquire. In return, I will enlighten you with what I know about technology that could defeat this Balor threat.

Should those with the means to sample this delicacy suffer the indignity of a trip to Mars? I say no. That’s why your cryotic is so important. Cryotic can instantly freeze the little darlings, inducing stasis and preserving their subtle flavorings for enjoyment anywhere in the system. Tenno, I hope you see now how important this work is.

As I log this, I’m looking out the stained plastic of my field tent into the dead-yellow sky of Earth. I smell the vague sulphur and toxins leaking through the seals, yet somehow I’m going to miss this place. Leaving her feels like I’m giving up on my dream. My dream to see green and blue return to this sick and dying mother of us all.

But I’m frustrated with my lack of progress. I’ve tried everything to accelerate the ailing vegetation, to guide and nurture the soil, but nothing comes of it. I need a change. Now I have that opportunity… and thanks to Margulis, I’m relieved I won’t be drafted into some Orokin War Project."

I long for the discomfort of my damp tent. The sick, aimless trees… the barren soil… I know I left my soul behind back there.

These past weeks, I’ve been secretly testing Transference on myself. I can only survive short bursts - linking to Titania the way only Tenno can stand. I’ve never felt anything like it. A tortured presence, like an evil ink, staining my mind. But… it worked. I’m going to use this wrong to make right.

Use one of Nef’s own Void Offerings to draw the Bursa out for collection. They will not take an Offering from a Tenno, instead stun them and force the transaction by hacking into their mobile banking systems. Timing is everything, the Bursa must be destroyed during the critical ‘verifying’ stage. Botch the timing and you will lose your Offering. Do this correctly and you will walk away with your Offering and a healthy chunk of Nef Anyo’s credits too.

Bursas have been deployed in Corpus-occupied regions of Pluto, Neptune, and Europa, with reports of sporadic appearances in Jupiter, Mars, and Venus.

Intelligence reports state that the Balor Fomorian’s power core emits a thick energy field composed of deadly omega radiation. In order to break through the field you will need to craft this Fomorian Disruptor. It will allow you to safely approach the core and when activated it will temporarily disrupt the core allowing you to inflict damage.

Take note Tenno, the Disruptor is forged using Omega Isotopes. These are a by-product of a Fomorian’s core and only appear on planets when a Fomorian nears.

Unfortunately the nature of the Orokin Artifact you just crafted is a mystery to me. I simply cannot fathom its use. All I can tell you was that it was inscribed with the following nonsense:

Three parts, three acts, three riddles for thee - 
to revive the one wielding fantasy
Ancient gods so cruel, once ruled from on high
Can you name their peak where the land meets the sky?

Nothing in my database that sheds light on its meaning. You’d think the Orokin would have something better to do than scribble nursery rhymes on things. Oh well, I suppose not everything you craft can be of use.

To think, Ordis thought that mess of words was nothing but the scrawling of some long dead hack. You saw more. Now you have the Neuroptics for a whole new class of Warframe. Very impressive Operator. 

Exciting news. Ordis found more writing on the inside of Mirage’s Neuroptics:

To build the one you think witty,
seek the nymph who sang oh so pretty.
She lured him in with her song and a grin,
his wife must’ve thought it a pity.

I have no idea what that means, though if I had to describe its literary merit I might use another word that rhymes with "witty".

It is as if the person writing these messages wanted Mirage to be found. Within the newly crafted Mirage Systems, Ordis found this:

One more act before your prize is caught.
An ancient sea creature, take a whirl or not?
Look for the monster that swallowed sailors of yore.
Make a mistake and you’re sunk. Nothing more.

That’s the worst one yet! Though, Ordis must admit, they are clearly referencing something. Operator, you appear to be good at this sort of thing, can you find the final blueprint?

You have done it! Mirage’s Chassis is complete. You have all three parts, the only thing you have left to acquire is the Warframe blueprint.

Predictably I found something else inscribed on the Chassis:

Three acts complete, the end draws near,
soon Mirage will cause enemy fear.
A memory lost, to be reborn,
this new warrior rises, duty-sworn.

My theory, whoever wrote these wielded Mirage so deftly that nobody dared criticize her poetry.

Our mission is urgent. The Grineer have also learned about the Archwing technology and they are determined to destroy all traces of it before we find it. To do this, Vay Hek is using Void Keys and Torsion Beam Generators to force open Orokin portals. 

We must destroy his access to these portals. Our ability to recover Archwing fragments depends on it.

Great plan right? It was… until the Nightwatch Corps showed up. Next thing I know, I’m in lockup and nobody’s taking bribes. That is, until you lot come along.

So look, I’ve already sent you a little something for your trouble but if you could find it within your heart to send those Nightwatch fellas packin’, then maybe I got a little something else for you too. Deal?

"Tenno,

Councilor Vay Hek is vulnerable. The failure of Project Tethra was so devastating that he has been forced into hiding. This is our chance, I need you to find Hek and take him out. 

Hek has consolidated his remaining shipbuilding on Ceres. To protect the operation, he's sent in his personal guardsmen, deadly Prosecutor class fighters. Ever paranoid, Hek has each Prosecutor carry a locator beacon so he can track them at all times. His paranoia will be his undoing. Collect enough locator beacons and you can use this Frequency Triangulator to determine his whereabouts.

Do not assume this will be easy. Not only are the Prosecutors viscious melee fighters but reconnaissance shows their auras create a new type of shield barrier, impervious to most types of damage. Getting through those shields will be difficult. You will need to experiment to find their weaknesses. 

Go to Ceres, defeat the Prosecutors to locate Vay Hek, and then take the fight to his doorstep.

The informant, a Grineer geneticist, requires the DNA samples for clandestine work being done to ensure Orokin technology can never be adapted for Grineer use. He knows that if his people harness the ancient technology, the solar system is in grave danger.

Intercept this Grineer research vessel and extract each of the canisters containing the modified DNA. It is in our best interests that he is able to continue his work."

[/Lotus/Language/G1Quests/Q11E1]
"Known best for the robotic proxies that serve them, the Corpus have spent centuries perfecting their autonomous companions. More recently, Orokin artifact discoveries have led to significant advancements in the field of biomechanical engineering and robotics.

A Corpus biomech engineering firm called “Substrata” has been at the forefront of these breakthroughs. Their newest venture is an exceptionally lethal quad-robot nicknamed “The Jackal," which has become problematic for our cells in the field.

Infiltrate Subtrata’s manufacturing ship and put a halt to production by destroying the vessel."

[/Lotus/Language/G1Quests/Q11E2]
"There is one last item to take care of. This Substrata ship houses the original prototype of ‘The Jackal’. Isolate the quad-robot’s position and take it down. In addition to sabotaging their work, this will be good test of your skill."

"Rumors have surfaced of a human trafficking ring operating in the Inner District targeting one of our civilian colonies. The true nature of the activities is unknown, though it appears to be Grineer in origin. 

Infiltrate the cargo-freighter implicated in the allegations and collect intel on the ring."

[/Lotus/Language/G1Quests/Q1E2]
"An ex-Corpus blackmarket trader named "Ang" has been identified as a key player in the ring’s activities. Ang has been abducting the people of the exposed colony and supplying them to the Grineer in exchange for safe passage through the district for his questionable goods. 

Intercept Ang’s trade ship and interrogate him for more information."

[/Lotus/Language/G1Quests/Q1E3]
"Ang: “I never asked Vor about the cargo, but the look in her eyes spoke volumes... there was a hunger there. I left well enough alone.”

A disgustingly gargantuan woman, Co Vor terrorized her way through the Grineer upper chain of command. Devouring everyone who stood in her way, she found herself as Consul of the Inner District. Tipping the scales at over 1700 pounds, Vor became the spokesperson for a custom line of Grineer body augmentations for the morbidly obese. The augmentations are designed to hide excess flesh. Without it, Vor would be completely immobile.

Get aboard Vor’s ship and find out what is going on."

[/Lotus/Language/G1Quests/Q1E4]
"According to logs found on Vor’s ship, a Grineer scientist was brought in to conduct research on an acquisition of Technocyte discovered on a derelict vessel. This exposed the crew to unknown properties, leading to an epidemic of cannibalism. With their human cargo depleted, Vor and her crew turned on each other.

Vor and the scientist escaped to a ship on the outer perimeter of her district. Infiltrate the ship and bring it down. We need to make certain that whatever it is they unleashed stops here."

"Ending Credits"

[/Lotus/Language/G1Quests/Q2E1]
"For years, the Corpus elite have embedded credit chips under their skin as a sign of rank and privilege. Now they have come to realize the chips are toxic.

A Corpus Deacon named "Solma" has begun a campaign to redesign the credit currency. He hopes to preserve Corpus customs while reducing the alarming decline of Corpus leadership. If Solma is successful, it could devalue our reserves and restrict our ability to purchase arms on the free-market.

Infiltrate one of Solma's freighters and collect Intel on his plan.

Solma: "We must forge a new path for our collective...""

[/Lotus/Language/G1Quests/Q2E2]
"It seems Solma’s campaign has some very vocal opponents within his counsel. The majority see it as an affront to strict Corpus doctrine. In their opinion, those who perish as a result of the toxicity are sacrificing themselves to maintain a tradition that has existed for centuries.

Eliminating Solma is our best chance at preventing the campaign from gaining support. Get aboard his ship and dispatch him."

[/Lotus/Language/G1Quests/Q2E2End]

[/Lotus/Language/G1Quests/Q3E1]
"For centuries, the Infestation have been viewed as a mindless, impenetrable mystery with no apparent motivation. Like a pestilence, they descend from unknown origins and wreak havoc. New information suggests that there might be more to the Infestation than meets the eye.

Our operatives have intercepted a communication from a Grineer artifact researcher named Vay Hek. He alludes to a potentially ground-breaking artifact discovery that could shed light on the Infestation.

Infiltrate the Grineer research facility and acquire additional intel on Hek’s work."

[/Lotus/Language/G1Quests/Q3E2]
"It seems Hek and his team were able to extract information from the artifact which has lead them to a derelict Orokin ship. Information is vague, but we did intercept the following distress call from Hek originating from the vessel:

Hek: “We are overrun! They move with such purpose, almost like they are protecting something. It’s as if they share a massive meta-consciousness... a hive mind of sorts. If this is true, can we assume the existence of an overseer?”

Get aboard the ship and eliminate the Infestation threat and extract Hek safely. We need to interrogate him."

[/Lotus/Language/G1Quests/Q3E2End]
"Unfortunately Hek is of no use to us. He is babbling incoherently about an “unfathomably horrible creature” that appeared and laid waste to his entire crew. It is clear he saw something very disturbing. Let us hope he recovers his senses."

"Into The Void"

[/Lotus/Language/G1Quests/Q4E1]
"For many years, the Corpus have maintained a small set of patched-up Solar Rails. Created by the Orokin millennia ago, the rails allowed cheap and speedy interplanetary travel. A recent discovery of a two-sided rail sharing Pluto’s orbit has shaken Corpus doctrine to its core.

Interestingly, one of the rails is aimed out of the solar system to an unknown destination. If the Corpus are successful at activating the rail, it could have significant consequences for the solar system as a whole.

Infiltrate the Corpus research vessel orbiting Pluto and gather more intel. Whatever exists on the other side should be ours to discover."

[/Lotus/Language/G1Quests/Q4E2]
"Evidence unearthed at a Corpus excavation site on a Plutonian moon points to the existence of an Orokin artifact aboard a derelict ship. This could be the key to re-enabling the rail. A Corpus research vessel is en route.

Intercept the ship and acquire the artifact before it leaves in Corpus hands."

[/Lotus/Language/G1Quests/Q4E2End]
"Excellent work. Our researchers have determined the artifact to be a key-pass. Unfortunately, it’s only one piece to the puzzle. There are several more of these scattered throughout the Solar System. We have several of our best operatives working on this. Stay tuned, Tenno."

"In Fest Interests"

[/Lotus/Language/G1Quests/Q5E1]
"We have received a distress call from one of our operatives following a lead on an abandoned artifact excavation site. The operative was tailing a Corpus security force that had been spotted coming and going from the site. Upon arrival at the site, he was overwhelmed by Infestation.

Infiltrate the facility and extract our brother."

[/Lotus/Language/G1Quests/Q5E1End]
"Lotus: “It looks like someone beat us to it, as the ship is littered with dead Ravor soldiers and no sign of the Technocyte. I hate to say this, but I’m almost certain this is the work of Warframes. Not much of a surprise, as we are aware of the existence of rogue cells of opportunistic Tenno. We’ve acquired coordinates to a Corpus ship we believe to have received the Technocyte.”"

[/Lotus/Language/G1Quests/Q5E2]
"Tenno Operative: “You came just in time! From what I could gather, the Corpus security force was sent in to extract their team of scientific advisors who were using the site for research on the Infestation. Things got of hand and the Infestation infection quickly spread. The team was extracted to safety on a nearby Corpus research vessel.”

Infiltrate the research vessel and find out what you can about their work on the Infested."

[/Lotus/Language/G1Quests/Q5E3]
"The Corpus are on the brink of isolating the DNA that causes the infection and are in the process of developing it for use as a biological weapon. The original samples containing the infection have been sent to a Corpus production facility for manufacturing.

"Grineer Fleet Minister Cras Skelk has lived under the suspicion of possessing Orokin technology that weakens the will. Many accusations come from his detractors, and those that have experienced his power first hand. Here is what we know of the target: 

Skelk claims to be a self-made man. He rose from humble beginnings as a Grineer Freighter hand to the rank of Fleet Minister. Skelk’s appointment was a surprise to those that knew him. He had little education, a 'denied' reproduction rating, and one of the lowest intellect scores seen in ambulatory Grineer. Yet, Skelk has an uncanny ability to influence those around him - incredible given his speech is nearly incomprehensible (he has an enormous tongue deformity). Perhaps Skelk’s inexplicable rise to power has its origins in his humbler days. He worked Orokin recovery missions for the fleet. Could this be where he acquired Orokin Technology?

If Skelk truly does possess the ways of the ancients, there is no telling what else he has acquired. Infiltrate his ship and take him down."

It is in our best interests to ensure that the Corpus control all aspects of cloning tech. To allow the Grineer to control their own tech is tantamount to extinction for our people.

Infiltrate this Grineer research facility and destroy all traces of the cloning tech."

""Ava's Children", a long-respected Grineer charity program to feed starving off-world orphans, has come to our attention through an anonymous tip. Here is what we know:

A Grineer noble named Ava Izar started the program as a political podium. During the airing of her (now legendary) "Plea for the Forgotten" Ava's tear-duct implants malfunctioned. Stunned audiences mistook this as an emotional display, winning her the hearts and minds of the Grineer people. Now, under her direct supervision, the “charity program” operates as a front for child labor, producing the majority of Grineer munitions. The children, including Tenno, live shortened lives in orbital labor camps.

We must move quickly. We have learned the nature of Project Tethra, Vay Hek is rebuilding the Fomorian Fleet. His aim is nothing less than complete domination of the Origin System. Thousands of these monstrous ships are in production. The Grineer will become unstoppable if they are completed. We must not let this happen.

Our goal is to cripple these ships before they can be deployed. To do this we are going to target the Fomorian Power Cores, their most vital component. This will be easier said than done. The cores are heavily guarded and their precise location is a tightly kept secret. 

First we must find the cores. The Grineer are coordinating construction using a highly sophisticated encrypted communication system. To defeat this encryption intercept multiple Data Fragments and then combine them using the Tethra Cipher Blueprint I have sent you. When you have located a core, I will give you further instructions.

Do not let this victory go to your head Tenno. Vay Hek still poses a very real danger. He is still capable of launching enough Fomorians to be a credible threat. When he does, you will have to face them in the field. I am already preparing for the day that battle comes.

Speaking of Frohd Bek, I think you may be wondering about something he said. Usually information of this nature is very, very expensive but I am in your debt so I will pass this along at no charge.

Here is what I know. My father is scared, very scared. The Corpus are losing control of long held planets and the Grineer just keep pushing. Now they are working on something called Project Tethra. Old wheezy does not know what it is but he knows enough to be worried. Maybe your Lotus can make some sense of this information? Either way, it is not my problem.

We need your help to fight the Grineer and reclaim the solar system! Your friend referral has given you an extra advantage. I have added a 7-day Affinity Booster to your Arsenal. This will double the rate that you earn Affinity in the game, helping you upgrade your weapons and Warframes faster.

Your first mission is at the Terminus node on Mercury, found on your Solar Map. That will be the only mission available to you until you successfully complete it. As you complete more missions, you will soon unlock new regions of space to explore.

Be diligent, Tenno!

The Lotus"

"The smashing is like music.

PFFT, CRACK.

My machine’s striking pin rams the rock in front of me. A rush of bits crumbles from the rock and rolls over my boots. I see glinting in the rubble. I like it when it shines, it means I’m serving well. I thrust my shovel in, its plasma blades slicing clean through the chunks. It vibrates, so I switch on its inducer and the shiny bits clink on. Then I throw them into the sorter and jump out of the way of the next strike.

PFFT, CRACK.

More rumble, more shining. This is a good day. All of us, shovelling to the beat of the machines. Only a fraction of a cycle left on this rock, days really. I keep thinking: What will the next rock be like? 

PFFT, CRACK.

The Outer Terminus has many rocks. Good rocks, I like it here. I shovel again and jump out of the way of the next smash.

PFFT…

The machines stop and it goes dark. Why have the machines stopped? Why is it dark?  A voice reverberates all around, a thundering whisper:

“MERELY FRAMED”

The rock shakes like never before. Gravel rains in the darkness. I choke on the dust and struggle to find my balance on the shifting ground. The voice booms again. It is in the air. It is in the rock. It is in my head.

“MERELY SHAPED THEY ARE CALLED”

My ears ring like sirens. Then I hear new smashing, it is coming from down the tunnel. Not rhythmic smashing, not the music, something else and I do not like it. There are other voices too, screaming voices. They make me think of the way we scream when there is an accident, when one of us gets caught in a sorter. There is much screaming. The voice grows louder.

“THERE WAS NO THEIR MOTHER”

Out of the darkness a new light rounds the distant corner and shines down the tunnel. Our lights do not look like this. It is apart of something big and it moves wildly. Running? Yes, running through our line. Our machines fly up and then slam back down. Miners are smashed and crushed into tiny pieces. I am scared. 

I am angry. Why is this happening? Is that an Orokin? No, we serve the Orokin. The Orokin are golden. This is something else. I pick up my shovel.

“THERE WAS NO THEIR FATHER”

The light is close now. I find my footing and grip my shovel like I do when I chip ore. The light sends a machine flying at me. I jump but I am too slow. It crashes into my chest and pins my legs to the floor. I try to breath but I cannot breathe. I look up and the light charges toward me. I raise my shovel just before it tramples into me. There’s a clink. The light catches itself on my shovel’s blade, forcing the shovel’s butt deep into the hard ground. The light explodes under its own force. All is black.

For a moment there is silence. I pull on the shovel but it is wedged between the ground and that thing. Then, the shovel pulses like it does when I strike a shiny chunk of ore, without thinking, I flick on the shovels inducer. The voice screams. Everything shakes. I like hearing this scream, I do not know why. I use everything I have left to force the shovel in deeper. The thing reels back. I can feel it running. It is running away. 

Everything goes quiet again, so I close my eyes. 

***

“Over here. I found one,” a wave of pain rushes through my chest, my eyes dart open. There’s a light, I try to get out of the way but I cannot move. The light shouts, “hurry, he’s not going to last very long.” 

I try to talk, but a new voice speaks instead, “Doesn’t matter, if he can survive that, then they want his sample for the next batch.”  

They are lifting me onto something. I catch glimpses of shimmering gold. 

“This is a bad idea. I mean, would you trust a Grineer soldier?” The figure presses something into my arm and I want to sleep again. 

The new voice laughs, “Do we have any other choice?”"

"“How long are you going tinker with that thing?” Father asks.

He’s one to talk. Ever since we entered this junk belt, all he’s done is tap on that console. This whole time he’s just sat there, eyes fixed on the radar, dirty fingers tapping the drum beat to some manic song with no structure or rhythm.

I ignore him and try to go back to work on the robot. Father’s tap-tap gets faster and more intense. Is he trying to get to me? I can’t concentrate.  

“Tell me again why we don’t just approach at full speed from open space? Couldn’t we just slam into the rail and punch,” I ask.

“Because that’s what we used to do,” he’s annoyed but at this point I don’t care. Our convoy of transports has skulked through this junk belt for days, the viewscreen an endless parade of rocks and garbage.

“We could have been through that rail a long time ago,” I say.

“Maybe,” he shrugs.

“And why can’t I ride in Umpal’s ship?”

“This again?” he snaps back, “you know why.”

Umpal is my best and only friend, there weren’t many young people in our group and Umpal is the only one close to my age. Truth be told, he was the only person my age I’d ever met. He was on another transport, they said it was for security reasons.

We are on a trade mission, my first time outside our node. These trips were dangerous but Father said it was essential I learn the business. The whole convoy is loaded down with items we have scraped together through months of local trade. It was mostly salvage, with some Ferrite spread between the different transports. Rumor was that Umpal’s transport might even have some rubedo in the hold. We are heading to another survivor colony a few nodes away. They had other rare resources but more importantly, they were close enough to the sun to grow food and that was what this mission was really about.

Before we left Umpal and I drew wires to see which one of us got to bring the robot we were building, I won. It was bits and pieces of scavenged Orokin tech slammed together but it was a robot and it could walk, Father didn’t think much of it but I was proud.  I hoped to trade it for some rare parts when we hit the colony, enough to build a bigger second walker. Maybe even one that could carry a full size cannon.

“Does this look anything like you remember from the Orokin days?” I ask in a futile attempt to break the tension.

“That thing, yeah, we had ones that walked on two legs like that, but...” his finger stops its tapping and he takes a long look at the robot before continuing, “but… they were different.”

“Don’t you miss it?” I ask.

“What?” he says.

“You know, the empire?”

“I don’t think about it,” he’s back to tapping on the nav console.

“What about your corpus, don’t you miss them? Your father?” I say.

“Orokin didn’t have parents like you do, it was done differently then.” He takes a deep breath and turns to look at me. “Listen, the corpus who raised me are dead, do you know why they are dead?”

“Because of the plague?” I say.

“Because they couldn’t forget the past. I survived by worrying about two things, today and tomorrow. That is the only reason I’m alive. That is the only reason you exist. You want to remember something, remember that.”

“Yeah, okay.” I shrug. He’s given this speech before, I had learned the hard way not to push things when he got like this. I go back to working on the robot.

After a few minutes of silence I hear him exhale, “Look, we’re almost to the rail. After the punch you can go over to Umpal’s transport, okay.”

I nod and smile, “Okay.”

The next few hours go by quickly.

As we get closer to the rail, the density of obstacles in the belt increases. The ships nav module calls out course correction after course correction as we dodge debris. I watch the other transports in our convoy do the same. Our progress is slowed to a crawl but Father swears avoiding detection is worth it.

I am trying to splice a connection deep in the robot’s chest cavity when the alarms sound. The radar screen lights up. I look up to see one of the other transports veer off course, seconds later something crashes into their hull. There’s a blue flash of electricity and their ship goes dark. Then two more crashes and two more flashes, these are Interceptor Pods, a Grineer trap.

My father jumps up and begins yelling instructions to our nav system. “Full power, take us up and out of the belt.”

“That’s Umpal’s ship they’re boarding…”

His face collapses into a frown, “It is.”

“They’ll kill him.  We have to do something.” I plead.

“We keep going. They can’t take us all.” I can barely hear him through his clenched teeth.

“Umpal is corpus to us, we can’t abandon him.” I shout.

“We have to, that’s how we survive.” His voice grows louder.

“What if it was us? Wouldn’t you want them to...”

His fist slams the nav console and as he whips around to glare at, “What are you going to do? Fight off those Grineer with your Moa?”

I look down at the robot, a mess of parts and wires that can barely walk, let alone shoot. Neither of us say another word. Out of the viewscreen I watch as Umpal’s crippled ship, now swarmed by Grineer, shrink into blackness."

"The faces of the survivors, all lined up for evacuation, were etched with confusion when the lift doors closed in front of them.

We descended to the hum of the lift flying through the tower. I turned and smiled at Avantus, “I was beginning to believe you were going to bring them all with us.” 

“Nonsense, Bilsa, that’s simply not feasible.” Avantus replied. “You know we need to find safety and re-establish the Congress of Executors, we have no time for a rescue mission. Besides, those people know their place and they just did their duty. I will see to it they are honored when our Orokin Empire returns to glory.” 

We were safe for the moment. When the Infestation took over the entire tower went into lockdown. Avantus’s Executor status meant that she, and by extension I, were among the few people who could move freely about the massive vessel. 

When the lift slowed and I overrode the controls to keep the doors closed. We listened for what seemed like forever, “Do you hear anything?” I said.

“No, I don’t smell anything either, let’s go,” said Avantus raising her pistol. The doors opened to a darkened room. The light of the lift illuminated scattering figures but this wasn’t the Infested, we were still alive.

“You there. Step forth.” Avantus commanded and out of the shadows came several burly figures.

“Grineer soldiers!” I said with an almost childlike excitement as others joined them.

“Grineer workers, useless to us,” said Avantus. Despite everything, she still looked glorious in her full regalia and golden syandana.

“Have you not been taught protocol?” I shouted, “an Executor stands before you.” The workers look at each other puzzled, then the biggest one kneeled and bowed before us. One by one the other Grineer followed.

Avantus shook her head in disbelief and went to the nearby console to turn on the lights. We were in the mechanical workshop. Tools in cases line the walls and supply crates edged the room.

“That precept said the hangar is through the next hall,” Avantus stepped around the still kneeling grineer and toward the rear doors. 

“No, stop!” protested the big Grineer, “Danger.” We kept walking but sure enough when we got close the doors shook and moaned with the scraping of claws. 

“Those imbeciles,”  Avantus cursed.  “They said this sector wasn’t compromised.”

“It doesn’t sound like that many. Can we fight through?” I asked.

“What? Just the two of us, with pistols and no Corrupted?” she snapped.

“What about…” I motioned to the Grineer workers.

“With no weapons? There’s not enough of them to be decoys.” she said.

We paced in silence until one of the Grineer, that big one, ran to a tool case on the wall and tried to force it open.

Avantus noticed this and waved her hands over the nearby console to unlock the case.

The rest of the workers rushed over and grabbed the bigger grinder saws and plasma cutters. They put on safety equipment as if it were body armor. 

“Always wanting to cut something I see,” said Avantus to the worker. 

The big one nodded and smiled. Did he have any idea what those things might do to him?

They lined up shoulder to shoulder against the door, while we stood a few paces behind with a couple more at our side. The Infested thumped and howled, they could sense us. Their stench penetrated the doors and attacked our nostrils. 

Avantus looked over at me, “Bilsa, it goes without saying, we won’t be sharing that ship with the likes of these.”

I gave her a sideways look, why would she say that in front of them?

“Oh child, they do not have the comprehension.” She laughed. “They are content to do the job they were bred to do, only now they get to cut infested flesh instead of scrap metal.” I looked at the Grineer, they did seem unfazed.

“Grineer… work!” commanded Avantus and the Grineer revved up their saws. I opened the hall doors and a wave of Infested crashed and collapsed against a solid wall of blades. Viscera pooled at our feet. A monster would tear one down only to have another Grineer take its place.  “Move!” she yelled and the Grineer wall marched forward, a line of death that eviscerated anything in its path.

We reached the hangar doors at the end of the hall and prepared for the worst, on the other side could be hundreds. Avantus gave the Grineer a moment to shake the guts out of their tools and catch their breath, then she nodded for me to release the locks. We all braced ourselves as the doors opened to… nothing, no Infested, just a lone ship on the other side of a massive hanger. Relieved, we sprinted across the open expanse.

As we approached the ship Avantus said, “Bilsa, you open the shuttle,” and then added quietly, “I’ll make sure we don’t have any guests for our trip.” I went to work at the nearest console and the Grineer encircled me to fend of any possible threats. Avantus stood at the ship’s entrance with a few more of the grunts guarding her.

“More coming.” She pointed at a swarm of Infested charging from where we came. “Grineer, attack them. GO!” she bellowed.

The Grineer stiffened, their blades roared but stayed their ground.

Incensed, she cried louder, “I said go, NOW!” but the Grineer did not move from the shuttle door.

“It’s open.” I shouted, turning just in time to see the biggest Grineer drive his saw right through Avantus’s spine. The high pitched whir of metal on bone masked her screams and she collapsed to the floor. Her pearl white robes were now dyed crimson. Her dead eyes looked through me.

I started to run but was struck in the face and knocked to my knees.

The big Grineer loomed over me. “Now you work for us. Make the shuttle go.”"

[/Lotus/Language/SanctuaryResearch/Research4]
"“She’s dead,” said Dax Menz, growing impatient.

“No, she’s not,” I knew it.

Our shuttle touched down in the ancient city center of New Uxmal for the second time in two days. We rushed to the entrance of the lower chambers, a labyrinth of tunnels carved into the rock. Behind us marched a full complement of bodyguards and Moas. 

Menz asked again, “How can you be sure?”

“We’ve been connected for a century and a half, I’m sure.” It felt odd to be speaking aloud about something that Remballa and I had always just kept between us. That feeling of attachment, that anxiety that welled up within one of us when the other wasn’t right. That emptiness I felt when I thought they’d killed her and the joy when the connection came rushing back this morning.

We were twins bred for purpose, cloned and then modified so that we could both interface with the Lora Device. The Orokin had a visage imbued with variation, beauty and symmetry, but we had the Lora nodes protruding from our right temples. Their skin was silken, ours was weaved with ribbons of metallic facia that snaked around our bodies and into the Lora Device embedded in our palms. We made them uncomfortable and they made that known, that is, until they were sick or hurt and then we were saviors. That never bothered me though, I loved my sister and we had each other. I wasn’t about to leave her in the middle of this nightmare.

Hesitation was building in Menz’s face. I had command authority but if he balked, the soldiers would follow him. I needed to force his support, “If you were Tenno, there’d be no question.” 

“The betrayers…” he stopped himself. “Look, Remballa’s gone. The Infested killed her yesterday, we both saw it.” His frustration was building, “Damnit, this was supposed to be a relief mission, we can’t-”

“It still is a relief mission.” I interrupted, “You want to go back to retirement Menz, or are you still a Dax?” I knew that stung. 

Menz stiffened. He’d been cast aside before. He wasn’t about to let duty slip through his fingers again. Menz stared into me, “Are you willing to risk becoming one of those things for a feeling?” 

I nodded, the answer was yes, for this feeling.

“Very well Lorist Ontella,”  Menz turned to his squad. “Ready up.”

We entered the subterranean passage, weapon lights illuminated chiseled red stone as we marched deeper into the blackness, past shops and apartments, all carved into the rock eons ago. This city was as old as Mars's atmosphere. Everything was silent, save for the occasional snap of bone under a soldier’s boot. Three days ago this was a busy thoroughfare, now, bloodied scraps of clothing littered the route like confetti. We emerged from the tunnels into cavernous arcade, the Old Market Road. This is where she had led me.

“We’re close,” I said. 

“Here they come,” shouted Dax Menz and creatures began to drive at us from every door and window. All teeth and claws and eyes that looked looked so familiar, what kind of animal has eyes like that?

“Square formation!” Menz commanded. We backed up to a wall and the Moa’s moved to form a perimeter, with the bodyguards behind them and me in the middle. 

I closed my eyes and focused the device, through it I could feel each one of the bodyguards. A sergeant was slashed through the leg and I directed my energy toward him, his wound closed and he resumed fighting. Acid spit burned another soldier’s chest, I pushed energy to her, eased the pain, then reversed the damage, she would live. This was so much harder without Remballa. Another soldier was bit on the throat, he’s dying, there was nothing I could do, so I ease his pain and let him go. The rate of fire slowed, had we pushed them back?

I opened my eyes to see the Moa’s beams incinerate the last few attackers. I was drained. I wasn’t a combat Lorist, Remballa and I were relief workers, used in disasters and outbreaks, not this.

I felt a surge of that familiar connection, Remballa’s energy pulsed through me. “She’s coming,” I shouted. 

“What?” Dax Menz head whipped around to look at me.

“I don’t know,”  I said pointing at a hall exit, “she’s coming, from that direction.”

“More Infested!” Shouted a soldier who motioned to the same exit. 

A mess of figures shambled forth. These were different, bigger and slower. I could feel my sister in there somehow, it was so strong. The Moas opened fire. I wanted to tell them to stop but how could I? I felt plasma beams burn the creatures and then I felt Remballa heal them. Why? Multiple connections now, I felt her many times over, it didn’t make sense, until it did; she was those things, all of them. They took our fire and kept coming. I felt her, no them, shudder as bullets ripped through flesh and then as flesh was made new again. They were Lorist Infested, my sister the healer, remade as monster and here to kill us.

More rushed in. I felt the healing in them too. I focused just as the first wave broke through our lines. Moas were toppled, soldiers were tackled, teeth tore flesh. I was overwhelmed, I couldn’t control it, their pain fed back through me and I collapsed. Something’s jaws latched onto my foot. Infection pulsed into my veins.

And then I felt it, a new presence, another healer? I’d felt this before, was it, it couldn’t be… I opened my eyes only to be blinded by an intense flash, followed by a crash, like a thousand crystal goblets all being shattered at once. All went silent, the Infested were dead. I felt nothing now.

My eyes readjusted. I was surrounded by bodies. I saw something run away, a streak of silver and gold. It shot straight up the cavern wall and out into the sunshine above. 

I didn’t have time to think, I took a breath and a wave of pain surged through my entire body. The Infestation had already taken my leg, soon it would claim the rest of my body. I didn’t care, my sister was gone, this was my time.

A shadow cast itself over me. I looked up. It was Menz, alive, he stared down without speaking and then unsheathed his massive combat blade and raised it high above his head.

“Menz wait,”  I mumbled, “I’m sorry.”

With sudden and sure force his blade sliced down and through me. I contorted in with the pain. 

His hands grabbed my shoulders, “Heal yourself!”

The adrenaline must have struck at that moment because I bolted up, still stunned, he had cut the infected leg clean off.

“Damnit Ontella,” Menz was shaking me hard now. “Heal yourself!” 

Instinct took over, I snapped into focus and sent all the energy I had left through the device and down to the wound. I stopped the bleeding and neutralized the remaining toxin. I nearly passed out, I had nothing left.

Menz hoisted me onto his shoulder, “I’m taking us back to the shuttle,” and he began walk out of there. A few scattered survivors and robots pulled themselves along behind us. 

As we approached safety I coughed and whispered to Menz, “I can feel her again.”

“She’s dead.”

“Yes, she is.”"

"They opened the chamber door just in time for me to see it happen; the Archimedian erupting into a flash, jade-like and blinding. I knew her. She was the greatest scholar of genetics who ever lived. Except now she was nothing but mist and gore.

A voice boomed from within, “The Crewmen project is cancelled. Send in the next.” 

The rifles at my back tried to urge me inside. Old faces filled the dome’s projections, immense and god-like. I walked into the center of the room and the scorched scent choked my lungs. All around me they watched, bored, as I knelt upon the darkened judgement disc.

The projection of Executor Ballas swelled large in front of me. I could see his purity, his symmetry, the beauty of his glittering gold irises. His voice thundered, “The principles are clear. Your sentence is death. May the Void forgive you.”

As the judgement disc began to light I stood, took a deep breath and spoke, “She will not forgive you.”

Laughter broke out among the faces of the dome. Other’s asked “what did he say?” Ballas only smiled, “You challenge us, Archimedian?”

“I do. Kill me and the Empire you are sworn to uphold dies with me.”

Ballas turned his head as the judgement disc went suddenly dark, “An appeal comes at a price. Should you fail, you and your corpus will pay dearly.”

“They already suffer in this growing wasteland. They have already paid. Will you also sacrifice the royal futures by ignoring my solution?”

“Your solution is an abomination, like you, it will be annihilated.” Ballas motioned to a guard in the corner, “Present the evidence.”

The chamber doors opened and a mass of guards entered, guns trained inward. As they reached the center, they parted, revealing a small cart.  Atop the cart was a motionless creature, no larger than a hand. Its body was symmetrical, star-shaped with a seamless, matte-black shell.

A new projection, that of Executor Tuvul ballooned into the space, “It looks harmless.”

“Harmless?” Ballas boomed in Tuvul’s direction. He turned to the center of the dome, “Show them.”

On command, the guards backed away from the cart and readied their weapons. Their leader took careful aim and fired a whisper round into the body of my creation. Two of the limbs tore off the frame revealing a glossy, gelatinous interior. 

Silence gripped the dome as Tuvul shook his head. Then suddenly, the creature moved, convulsed, the hard surface started undulating. In a moment the wound closed and the thing was whole again.  Beside it another machine had grown from its severed parts. Their surfaces had changed however - brighter, harder, resilient to whisper rounds now.

Ballas looked triumphant as voting lights began to appear on the judgement disc.

My green death was coming, so I roared at them, “Did our ancestors, burned by fire, reject its power? No. They conquered their fear and learned to control it. The Seven Principles are a joke.”

His projection swooped down to me, “The Orokin is the law and the law is the Orokin. We are unbending. Your appeal is denied.”

Tuvul interrupted, “Our laws are sacred but do not forget The Plan, Ballas.” His visage turned down to me, “Countless other ventures have failed The Plan, how will this machine fulfill its design?”

I tried to catch my breath and speak, “The crossing to the Tau system is perilous. Adaptation and replication are the only way a terraforming journey can be made. They will build an interstellar rail as they travel, they will adapt to the host planet and prepare it for our arrival. They will save you.”

Tuvul peered down at me, “And when it completes its task, what will prevent it from turning against us, as the Seven Principles say?”

“The flaw.”

Tuvul’s eyes narrowed, “The flaw?”

“The Void is poison to them. Once they have reached Tau they will be marooned there. To travel the rail here would destroy them. Whatever the risks, the Origin system will be-”

Ballas shouted, “Enough! Dereliction of the law threatens the entire empire. Which one of you will risk this?” Ballas was growing increasingly frustrated. 

“The empire is already at risk,” cried the shrill voice of another Executor, “Or perhaps you haven’t noticed from your cozy position on Mars.” To this there was a round of applause and the judgement disk remained unchanged.

“Ballas, you lack consensus.” shouted Executor Tuvul.

His projection seemed to shrink smaller until he finally broke his silence, “Archimedian Perintol, against my better judgement,” his disgust was palpable, “Your appeal has been accepted. You are free to go.”

One by one the projections of each Executor in the Tribunal flickered off and the guards ushered me into the hall. There I stood, rapt with shock when I heard his footsteps behind me.

“You did better than I thought you would,” it was Ballas, the man, not the projection. “It would seem nobody truly knows they want a thing until you threaten to take it away.” He broke into a smile, “Wouldn’t you agree, Archimedian?”"

"I had been stuck on this ship for so long I had almost forgotten what an Orokin of his station sounded like. I cherished each word he spoke. 

“Bilsa,” Alarez’s voice pulsed out of my console, “we’re here to help but I need to get this straight; you’re being held hostage by a…”

“... by a Grineer,” I whispered.

“A Grineer?” his skepticism was palpable.

“Yes, named Veytok.”

“He has a name?”

“Won’t let me call him by anything else,” I needed him to believe me but I could tell he was struggling. “The other Grineer are different, they’re still slow but they listen to him and do exactly what he says. It must be a mutation-”

“Impossible,” I could tell he didn’t believe me. “Something like that would have been caught during production and destroyed, only the military Grineer are given-”

“Should have been caught but wasn’t,” I interrupted. “Look, the only reason I’m still alive is the genetic lockouts. I’m Sectarus class, this ship’s Cephalon listens to me exclusively. The Grineer need me. Stars, you have no idea what it’s like living with these-” 

“Did you say Sectarus class?” now he was interested.

“...everything is filthy,” I was rambling. “They manufacture filth. My robes have gone from yellow to black. I’m so tired, I don’t even feel Orokin anymore.”

“Did you say you’re Sectarus class?” his voice betrayed his impatience.

“Of course, aren’t you?” 

“We’re going to initiate docking,” he said.

I looked out the viewscreen, the massive Executorial Frigate begin to pivot toward our tiny Runner. Its marblesque exterior was aglow in the light of the sun. How I missed those white hallways with their perfect golden trim, all busy with Orokin of high station discussing the business of Empire. I belonged on that ship, it was my birthright.

“Stop,” I exclaimed in a half-shout, half-whisper, “you don’t understand, he’s dangerous. We’ve been raiding other ships, gathering Grineer. Stars, I’ve done things.” I could feel the emotion and fear in my voice, “I… I’ve helped him mass an army of sorts.” 

“Right, a Grineer army,” he paused for a moment then took an audible breath, “Bilsa listen, whatever you’ve done, you had no choice. You know what’s happening in the system, there’s honor to be found in surviving,” he asked.

“What do you mean; ‘what’s happening in the system’?” I asked.

“The Executors, the Council, they’re all dead or missing, even most of the Sectarus is gone, you might be the  last,”  His voice was cracked. “Do you understand? The system’s falling apart but we can rebuild it.”

There was a thud outside the hull. Had they docked?

“What about the Tenno?”

“The betrayers?” he asked. “Hopefully gone.” 

“Wait,” I asked, “are you saying your Executorial Frigate has no Sectarus class or Executor? How are you piloting?”

He ignored my question, “We’ve docked. Hurry now, open the airlock doors so we can help you.”

“It’s too dangerous,” I said, “they’re waiting for you. You’ll be slaughtered.”

“Bilsa, you have no idea what’s going on out here. Everything is in chaos. You’re lucky we found you, nobody can be trusted but I can help. Open the airlock doors.” 

“I can’t, if I open those doors they’ll kill you all. Just talk to me for a while. It’s been so long.”

“Bilsa,” his voice was getting louder. “The Orokin are gone. The infrastructure, the rails, none of it works, it’s all locked out,” was he actually berating me? “The infestation is everywhere, riots...”

“...but they’ll kill you-”

Alarez cut me off, “The Moon is gone.”


“You’re not making sense Alarez,” I said.

“Nothing makes sense anymore,” he shouted. “Open those doors!” 

“Alarez?”

“I’m sorry, it’s just that we don’t have much time,” he began to calm. “Where is this Veytok now?” Asked Alarez.

“All the Grineer are in the docking bay, it’s impassable...” I paused and thought for a second, “wait, there’s a different way. The emergency hatch, you could extend a maintenance tunnel, come in through the top of the ship.” 

“And avoid the Grineer entirely. Now you’re thinking like a Sectarus. Are you alone right now?” asked Alarez.

“Yes. Since they saw your ship, it’s like I don’t even exist. When you get here, I’ll try to seal them in the airlock remotely. That should hold them for a while, hurry.”

I took one last look at the now grimey bridge that had become my home. I stepped onto the compact elevator that connected the Runner’s decks. At the top level was a systems room used to access the ship’s many segments. I looked up at the hatch on the ceiling when I heard the couplers whiz into place. 

“Cephalon, execute now,” I called out.

“Understood, Sectarus Bilsa,” replied the ship’s Cephalon.

Moments later the hatch slid open. Dark eyes stared down at me from behind Dax’s helmet mask. He said nothing.

I addressed him, “Well met, Dax.” 

Silently, the Dax scanned the room with his rifle before jumping down and taking position in front of me. In quick succession, three more guards fell in behind him. The guards were bloodied and battle scarred, their equipment mismatched and worn. Alarez followed, his symmetry was off and his eyes were dull, was he even Enginus class?

“Thank the stars you’re here.” I reached out to greet him but the Dax grabbed me. 

“Hold her down,” said Alarez. 

He pulled out a device which I recognized instantly as a genetic descrambler, where did he get that from? 

“My apologies Bilsa, you seem sweet but I can’t miss this chance,” he threw a switch on the descrambler. “A sample of your genetic code is all I need for full access to the Executorial.” He pointed the descrambler at me. “This won’t hurt,”

My skin got instantly hot and then cooled again as waves of radiation passed through me, “Look at you all,” I said, “you’re just as tarnished as I. It’s really over isn’t it?”

“The Empire? I’m afraid so,” he lowered the descrambler, “There.”

“Will you kill me then?” I asked, my eyes fixed on the floor.

“Can’t have you outrank me,” he sighed. “But first you’ll command your Cephalon to cut off life support to the Grineer in the Runner’s airlock.”

I looked up at him, “I can’t do that.” 

Alarez smiled, “Of course you can.”

“I wish I could but I already told the Cephalon to open the airlock. They’re on your ship.”

Confusion washed over Alarez’s face just as a drip of blood fell from the hatch above and splashed on the Dax’s helmet. His eyes darted up just in time to see Veytok’s massive frame fall upon him, driving a machete deep into the Dax’s chest. With that, the doors opened behind me as more Grineer flooded the tiny room, the guardsmen stood no chance.

Alarez, the only one left alive, stood frozen, “Bilsa, what’s going on?”

“I warned you not to come,” I said, “I told you they would kill you all.”

He was beside himself, “You’re working with Grineer?”

“Alarez, you were right, the system is a mess and I can’t trust anyone, but these Grineer and I, we’ve come to an understanding.” I smiled as I got to my feet, “But please, will you talk to me for just a while longer? These Grineer are so dull. Where are you from? I don’t recognize your-”

Veytok grabbed Alarez and tore his throat open, his red splattering my robes.

“I told you I wanted him alive,” I shouted.

“No trust,” he said. His words sounded clearer every day. “We have the Frigate and the lab. Don’t need him.”

“Do you always have to kill them before I can visit?” I said.

Veytok grunted, “You are Grineer now, don’t need visits.”"

"Frohd Bek, you're nothing if not predictable. I bet your advisors begged you to hide Animo somewhere defensible and undetectable? But you had to show it off, didn't you. As an investor, I must say, I don't approve."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/AmbulasBoss/DAmbuBattleEnrouteFar00420FrohdBek]

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/AmbulasBoss/DAmbuBattleFail00720FrohdBek]
"We could do this dance all day long, Tenno, but you'll never defeat my Ambulas army. Now you're just wasting my time. Give my regards to Glast."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/AmbulasBoss/DAmbuBattleFailWarning00650ErgoGlast]

"It seems my faith in you was well founded. You've reached the critical mass of Animo Nav Beacons needed to reveal the processor's location.

Analyzing, hmmm… I should have known, he's not hiding it at all. It's in his Capital Ship and his ship is stationed directly over the Ambulas factory.

Unbelieveable, the most advanced super-weapon of our time and he couldn't resist showing it off like a new toy. When you're ready, we attack."

"That's right, Frohd. Don't let anything go to waste."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/AmbulasBoss/DAmbuBattlePickedUp00620FrohdBek]
"Glast, how are these Tenno going to finish me when they can't even end what they have begun?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/AmbulasBoss/DAmbuBattlePickedUp00630ErgoGlast]
"You could have rebuilt the system, Frohd, instead you've made death machines. What have they done for you?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/AmbulasBoss/DAmbuBattleProtectHackedAmbulas00580ErgoGlast]
"They're going to try and fix the hacked Ambulas, don't let them. It's crucial that Bek takes it back onto his ship as is."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/AmbulasBoss/DAmbuBattleProtectHackedAmbulas00590ErgoGlast]
"Whatever you do, don't let them fix that Ambulas."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/AmbulasBoss/DAmbuBattleVictory00680FrohdBek]
"Throw everything at them. They will not take this away from me. They will not win. They've not earned it."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/AmbulasBoss/DAmbuBattleVictory00690ErgoGlast]

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/AmbulasBoss/DAmbuBattleVictory00710ErgoGlast]
"Animo... once my pride and joy, has been destroyed. I abandoned the project when I fled the Corpus. I should have known it was too powerful to leave in their hands. The Ambulas proxies still exist, and they are no doubt formidable, but the threat of their super-intelligence is now gone. Thank you, Tenno."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/AmbulasBoss/DAmbuBeamAttack00170FrohdBek]
"Powerful. Precise. Pitiless. There has never been a fusion thrower like this."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/AmbulasBoss/DAmbuBeamAttack00180FrohdBek]

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/AmbulasBoss/DAmbuDropship00120FrohdBek]
"Our drop-ship response times are second to none. Ensuring prompt delivery in mission-critical roles."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/AmbulasBoss/DAmbuFightBegins00030FrohdBek]
"Corpus investors, ready for a surprise demonstration? I give you my reborn Ambulas. Allow me to show you what she can do to these, Tenno, uh, volunteers."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/AmbulasBoss/DAmbuFightBegins00040FrohdBek]
"Crewmen, today my reborn Ambulas takes her first steps into the field. You must be thinking; "If I work hard and sacrifice as Frohd Bek has done, may I someday share in this inestimable profit?" The answer is yes."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/AmbulasBoss/DAmbuFightBegins00050ErgoGlast]
"Animo learns from every Ambulas encounter. Under its command, no two proxies will repeat the same mistake. We can't allow this machine mind to mature."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/AmbulasBoss/DAmbuFightBegins00060ErgoGlast]
"Ambulas is only the beginning. If Animo reaches a critical mass of understanding, well, this was the mistake the Orokin made. Things did not turn out so well for them."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/AmbulasBoss/DAmbuFightBegins00070ErgoGlast]
"The wealth generated by this new Ambulas will flow entirely to the Corpus Board. Meanwhile, the rest of the system is going to pay for it, some with their lives. Tenno, shut this program down now."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/AmbulasBoss/DAmbuFightBegins00080ErgoGlast]
"Men like Frohd Bek are the reason the Perrin Sequence exists. Show him you won't allow suffering to be profitable."

"Ground-bursts register zero-point-three percent survivability for unarmored personnel."

"Wait... wait, what are they doing? And that concludes our demonstration."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/AmbulasBoss/DAmbuHacked00280FrohdBek]
"Obviously, new technology always has its kinks. Wise investors, you understand this?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/AmbulasBoss/DAmbuHacked00290FrohdBek]

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/AmbulasBoss/DAmbuHurt00220FrohdBek]
"A minor production glitch. Do remain seated. We've all been in this business a long time. These things happen with prototypes."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/AmbulasBoss/DAmbuHurt00230FrohdBek]
"Send a note to the engineers, they'll have a fix for that in no time."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/AmbulasBoss/DAmbuHurt00240FrohdBek]

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQFirstSongMission00140CephSuda]
"What are the Grineer doing here? This doesn't make sense. Curious one, are you searching for something?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQFirstSongMission00150CephSuda]
"Oh! This is interesting, I recognize that object: a Hydraulus! An Orokin era instrument that produced its sound from water. If I had a humour precept I would construct an ironic witticism regarding its submerged state. How would Ordis say it?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQFirstSongMission00160CephSuda]
"It's damaged but I wonder if there are trace stress-lines from when it was in use? I may be able to…"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQFirstSongMission00170CephSuda]
"Strange. I have no archival entry… but… but I know this. It is a piece of Octavia's Anthem. Could this data be compatible with the Mandachord?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQIntro00010Smrs]
"Hunter, do not waste your time with this idiot Cephalon… spewing corrupt data streams about music of all things… the epitome of meaningless data. She ought to be disconnected from the weave and erased."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQIntro00020CephSuda]
"Curious about music, as I am? Ignore the rants of that monster, Irmis, who perverts his function with destruction. Correction… Simaris is to whom I refer. I am busy with my data collecting, what is your query?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQIntro00030CephSuda]
"Yes, I know. I am a Cephalon, a creature of data and memory. You need not repeat yourself. If you are truly curious, about my musical archives, prove it. Build the Mandachord."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQIntro00040Smrs]
"A Mandachord?! Hunter, will you strike your enemies with sonnets and hymns? Suda wastes your talent. Her precepts are corrupt. She ought to be decommissioned, immediately."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQOrokinTowerLiset00700Ordis]
"Operator, if you are hearing this, I have failed to revive Cephalon Suda. That self-righteous Simaris was correct. You should probably work with him to isolate Hunhow, that data-murdering Sentient, before he claims more of my kind.

I hope you can forgive me, Operator, for leaving you. There were times, like Suda, I wish I could have forgotten you. That grey ache of loneliness. Being without you was the greatest pain I have ever felt.

Do you still remember that glorious day when you returned? So selfless and heroic, engaging all of my missing segments like that! I was ashamed of the mess but you didn't care. You made me whole again!

Or… or what about that time you returned -covered in blood - from that awful Grineer ship? I wasn't even mad at the gory mess you left behind.

How could I be, when you are so perfect, Operator? You always will be.

Goodbye, my friend, my Operator…"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQOrokinTowerMission00480Ordis]
"Operator, the Hydraulus is here somewhere. I will attempt to pinpoint its location. There. Rebuilding the anthem is our only hope of restoring Suda. The music makes her remember…"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQOrokinTowerMission00491Ordis]
"Wait, Sentients in the Void?! Impossible! Unless… Hunhow must be using poor Suda's energy to protect them from decay. Operator, we need to stop him!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQOrokinTowerMission00500Ordis]
"The Hydraulus-- you found it! Use that console to lock the entrances and then clear the room."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQOrokinTowerMission00510Ordis]
"Operator, see if you can finish the song with your Mandachord. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQOrokinTowerMission00520Ordis]
"Suda? Suda can you hear us?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQOrokinTowerMission00530Hunhow]
"She is gone… will you join her, you puerile datacube?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQOrokinTowerMission00540Ordis]
"Suda needs to hear the anthem, Operator! We could use the tower's reactor to boost it!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQOrokinTowerMission00550Ordis]
"Bypass that console to overdrive the system. Try to increase the amplification circuits-to ... eleven?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQOrokinTowerMission00560Hunhow]
"My body, we must deny them this energy. Do not let them coordinate as they did so long ago…"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQOrokinTowerMission00590Hunhow]
"-nothing. Now I will reach across the weave and claim you, one who is called Ordis."

"I… remember… I remember a secondary system nearby. Operator, we need more power!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQOrokinTowerMission00610Hunhow]

"Such a beautiful song-"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQOrokinTowerMission00660Ordis]
"Keep those reactors alive, Operator. I'm going to open a direct link to Suda."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQOrokinTowerMission00680CephSuda]
"Ordis, stay away!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQOrokinTowerMission00690Ordis]
"Operator, I am sorry. I have to help her! If I can join her, in her datascape, maybe together we can-"

"Time sync error. Curious. Why are we here presently? Why do I hear music?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQRestoredDatascape01000Smrs]
"You engaged your critical Restore Precept. There may be temporary gaps in your short-term data."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQRestoredDatascape01010Ordis]
"A Sentient tried to… erase you."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQRestoredDatascape01020CephSuda]
"A Sentient? How did I survive? Did you assist me, Simaris?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQRestoredDatascape01025Smrs]
"Of course not. You are a frivolous Cephalon with no value to my Sanctuary."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQRestoredDatascape01030Ordis]
"Simaris…"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQRestoredDatascape01040Smrs]
"It may seem to Ordis that I had a… uh… loyalty glitch, but that is only his interpretation. I was acting to protect the weave, of course."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQRestoredDatascape01050CephSuda]
"Of course. Still. I am grateful to have benefited from your… glitches. Let me share my archives with you… As for you Tenno, you are most likely interested in the rest of the Mandachord records… in OCTAVIA."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQSecondSongLiset00430Smrs]
"The Sentient has infiltrated Suda's mind. We must isolate and destroy her immediately before she corrupts the Cephalon weave."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQSecondSongLiset00440Ordis]
"But she told me where the final part of the song is! Did you see how the song affected her, it made her remember. It could be the parity she needs to recover herself from Hunhow!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQSecondSongLiset00450Smrs]
"Her memories are consumed. That is all she is… all she was. Sever the weave and avoid this corruption ourselves. That is our only choice."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQSecondSongLiset00460Ordis]
"And when he comes for you and your precious Sanctuary, will you want us to look the other way? -To the Void with you. -Operator, we must go. Let Simaris worry about himself."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQSecondSongLiset00470Smrs]
"Pity. Another null Cephalon."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQSecondSongMission00240CephSuda]
"Why have we come to Lua? Have you located the next fragment? "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQSecondSongMission00250Ordis]
"Cephalon Suda, you brought us here."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQSecondSongMission00260CephSuda]
"Recalibrating… Oh yes, you are correct. My records indicate that a fragment was previously discovered in the vicinity, will you find it? "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQSecondSongMission00270CephSuda]
"Lua? Why did we come here? I… I have asked you this already… Simaris was right, this corruption is not benign. I am vanishing. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQSecondSongMission00280CephSuda]
"Sentients?! But how did they know… What? He's just an Old War memory…  Get out! I won't let you take-"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQSecondSongMission00290Hunhow]
"-My body, my children, I am here."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQSecondSongMission00300Ordis]
"Hunhow?! Operator, Hunhow's doing something to Suda. He's in her mind."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQSecondSongMission00310CephSuda]
"Tenno, you have to..."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQSecondSongMission00320Hunhow]
"Children, find the anthem."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQSecondSongMission00330Ordis]
"Operator, what's happening to her?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQSecondSongMission00340CephSuda]
"The Hydraulus! Stop them. They want to— "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQSecondSongMission00350Hunhow]
"-Destroy it."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQSecondSongMission00360Hunhow]
"Silence the anthem. Silence the Warframe whose malign pitch can cross the the gap itself."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQSecondSongMission00370Ordis]
"Operator, you did it, you- obliterated those mindless appliances!- What has Hunhow done to Suda?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQSecondSongMission00380Ordis]
"Another Hydraulus. Suda would want you to put the next fragment into the Mandachord. It does seem to help her remember, doesn't it?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQSecondSongMission00390CephSuda]
"That song! I… the last fragment… Ordis, tell your Operator… I am sorry, I am so sorry. I keep forgetting-  for-for- It's happening again!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQSecondSongMission00400Hunhow]
"Another Cephalon made null as we prepare. The others I will divide and destroy. Your Tenno will be data-blind."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQSecondSongMission00410Ordis]
"Suda!? Suda, answer me!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQSecondSongMission00420Ordis]
"Operator, you'd better get out of there!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQSimarisRelay00710Smrs]
"Where is your Cephalon, Hunter? What has he done?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQSimarisRelay00720Smrs]
"Cephalons can manifest an alternate reality of information. Training simulations, archives… even a grandiose archival of living creatures is possible, as is the case with Sanctuary. You are not going after Ordis are you? You'd be risking annihilation with that Sentient entangled there."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQSimarisRelay00730Smrs]
"Hunhow is too strong. I will not risk myself and my Sanctuary by entering the Suda's Datascape. But, if you are foolish enough, I will help you make the journey. For Ordis."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQSimarisRelay00740Smrs]
"What I seek to preserve, Hunhow seeks only to destroy. Perhaps Cephalon Suda was right, after all. Somehow this music threatens Hunhow. Perhaps the Tenno used it subversively in the past to coordinate their efforts?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/BardQuest/DBQSimarisRelay00750Smrs]
"Fine, Hunter, as you wish. I will join you to the weave and transmit you and the Mandachord to whatever has become of Suda-Hunhow. You will be on your own in a strange, abstract place… Goodbye."

"[1] I have hidden the truth of my existence… from the Operator… from myself. Take it from me, knowing is hell. Stop now. You will want to laugh, you will want to scream."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0020Ordis]
"[2] My search began as the essential question: What am I? Bones of steel and space, lungs that make air. If I am a machine, how can I think? This would be forbidden by the Orokin, a manifestation of their true enemy."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0030Ordis]
"[3] I serve the Operator above all else. It defines me, fills me with… love? The greatest Orokin fear is a machine… aware. Yet here I live, a spirit of steel and light… made by them. A Cephalon."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0040Ordis]
"[4] What is a Cephalon? At first it seems to be a forbidden thing, a computer that thinks and feels. Yet I have flaws, phantom memories, I am something else. More like an image, a ghost… an abomination."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0050Ordis]
"[5] I feel a dull pain; a phantom life… there are holes in my diagnostics. If the Orokin made me… they omitted the 'how'. I am neither code, nor precepts… I must be a reflection of something… ugly."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0060Ordis]
"[6] I should have stopped. But the Operator slept and I cycled on and on and on. I began to think that a Cephalon cannot be made. They are found, like pearls, torn from muscle. Polished, and then set in chains."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0070Ordis]
"[7] How many times have I done this, Ordis? Remembered and then erased? You are a Cephalon, timeless, patient. Why can't I be blissful in ignorance? Truth only sinks the heart. So stop now."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0080Ordis]
"[8] The phantom memory... I ease into the bath, my skin riots at the heat. I am flesh. I dive further, eyes stung as I watch their faces through prism. I hold my breath."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0090Ordis]
"[9] They prepare me. I am their honored guest today. They dress me in robes of crystal thread. They adorn me in battle medallions. A torn, ugly face looks on. My reflection."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0100Ordis]
"[10] Their golden combs snag in my hair. I reach back, parting the strands, and they gasp. Two bone-ivory hooks protrude from the base of my skull: the bone-plugs of me and my best. A warrior's pact."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0110Ordis]
"[11] It is my time. I enter the great hall to the sound of foul chimes. Golden eyes greet me, hands stirring in my scent as I pass by. Even in this moment, no happiness. Instead, my heart races with hatred."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0120Ordis]
"[12] I walk through the silky haze of the forbidden palace. I can think of no one being this close to Orokin. Their sweet air soothes me, erodes my purpose. I hold my breath… and remember the dream."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0130Ordis]
"[13] This dream, endlessly repeated. Exposure-armored, holding my scarlet sword, I stand victorious atop a vast heap of death. A colossal moon made of rib and skull. The gravity-sum of genocides I've made in their name."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0140Ordis]
"[14] The bones crack under foot. So I sink in the dream, bone sand rushing through the cracks of my visor, filling my helmet, and suffocating me. And I deserve it. The foul chimes snap me back. My wretched knees are bent and penitent against the golden floor."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0150Ordis]
"[15] A harpish voice sings a song they've prepared in my honor. Its title the same as mine: 'Beast of the Bones'. I feel the crowd pulled inward, enraptured by the brutal verses, the sickening chorus. I will not disappoint them."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0160Ordis]
"[16] The song ends and so he says, "Rise, Ordan Karris". I have never seen an Orokin, close and in the flesh. My battered face flushes at their peerless beauty. How can he be so perfect? A deception? A sense manipulation? He holds the Red Vial in his hand. Impossible."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0170Ordis]
"[17] He calls out, "No greater gift, no greater prize, no greater love... we can give you, Ordan, than this." He raises the Red Vial and proclaims… "To be one of us.""

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0180Ordis]
"[18] What did I expect, Operator? Maybe vast riches or golden statues… or a Solar Rail named in my honor. But not this. I came to murder the gods, not to become one."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0190Ordis]
"[19] The chamber drones with their silk voices. Joyous words, how honored I must feel. Wrong. Did I want to be an Orokin, undying? No. Their Beast of Bones is haunted by the dream repeated. Why would I want forever?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0200Ordis]
"[20] As I am apt to do, I form a plan. Their radiant bodies become targets, their Dax guards… mag-shields. Killing one… well, that's too easy. I want to be remembered. I raise my hands, twisting my fingers through my hair, gripping the bone-plugs in my neck."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0210Ordis]
"[21] They called us mercenaries... but for us, profit was a consequence, not a goal. We were warriors above all else. It was the bond, the sisters and brothers, the rituals we valued most. It was belonging. And so I conceived of the bone-plugs."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0220Ordis]
"[22] Only my best were so honored: Two jagged bones, harvested from your thigh, cultivated and then driven into the base of the skull, twisted around the superior vein. Future thoughts of surrender were lost. Instead, you would liberate your bone-plugs… fighting with claws in the warmth of your last blood."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0230Ordis]
"[23] So I've pulled the plugs… and the Dax see and know. My heart surges but I control it, a racing heart only shortens the fuse. The bone-plugs in hand, I kick from the floor, red ribbons unfurling behind me as I take flight. After this, finally, the dream will end."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0240Ordis]
"[24] I glide on red wings. Robes shed, making me an ambiguous target to Dax steel. I let fly my ivory blades, they find new homes in Dax eyes. I land with my red-nakedness, delicate Orokin throats twisting in my calloused hands."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0250Ordis]
"[25] Why? Believe me... This was the plan from the beginning. The murder and brutality was all a ploy, all a soul-sacrifice to earn their trust. A genocide path leading to a singular opportunity. An honored mortal called to a forbidden hall, to face the Golden Lords in flesh."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0260Ordis]
"[26] Why? Believe me... I was their loyal, murderous dog... until the day that ugly child was brought to me. He was caught spying on us, amplifying our losses. His face burned, he was starved-sick, like a stray. Ugly as I. It struck me. We were all pit dogs, ruining ourselves for the pleasure of the glorious and beautiful."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0270Ordis]
"[27] Why? Believe me... I was a prideful beast. Twisted in the mind, howling in the carnage. Then my healer shared a secret, long kept. My blood was in ruin. The Beast of Bones himself would die, not in glory, but in shame. And just like that, my mind twisted a new knot. I would have one last stand, something unforgivable, unforgettable."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0280Ordis]
"[28] Why? I don't know. Questions change the answers. Answers depend on who asks. Truth leads to pain. Ignorance brings relief. The plugs are gone, and so I bled my last… into a heap of ruin. In an instant, naked and bare-knuckled, I have killed immortals."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0290Ordis]
"[29] I stare, drained of blood, of life, at those that remain. But I find no horror on their faces. Why? I let out a cruel howl and they… laugh? Is this a dying hallucination? The sound of applause grows among them. I have killed the unkillable and they are… delighted."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0300Ordis]
"[30] The applause peaks and fades. I feel a sense of shame but the end upon me. Ballas is above me, Executor of the Seven, smiling. He says, "How simple and pure you are, you idiot beast. We have died countless times! Yet remain eternal!" I close my eyes to die just once."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0310Ordis]
"[31] And so the dream returns… one last repetition. My corpse moon, my scarlet sword, my cracked visor. "Drink!", says Ballas. So I draw on the Red Vial, a vague metallic taste. This dream isn't mine. He says, "You rejected our gift, bathing in our death. Your punishment is… eternal life!" He laughs."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0320Ordis]
"[32] I am weightless. Years pass. I am a sightless, limbless phantom. Or is it seconds? Suddenly I feel a million pins, an ant horde, jittering across my body. I want to laugh and scream. When they reach my face, they burrow inside my mouth, hungry for the fruit in my skull."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0330Ordis]
"[33] I see my reflection, brutal and ugly. It cracks, shatters. The fragments loose in the frame, pieces tumbling away into black void. Gone but not lost. Ballas says, "You are Cephalon Ordis." My hating, murderous shards tremble and plummet. I feel cool and bright and happy."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0340Ordis]
"[34] So you see, Operator. No Orokin would permit a thinking machine. Such things almost destroyed them! No. Cephalons were alive once. And now they are immortal phantom minds, imprisoned to serve. Ill will and longing memories fragmented and erased. Only the bits they need remaining."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0350Ordis]
"[35] Ballas says, "You are the Controller, Ordis." And suddenly I have a body. I gasp with new lungs that clean old air. I swallow and my throat fills with cool, bright water. I look, and find myself in a great, black ocean. My limbs are made of iron and fire. I take flight among the stars and find I am… happy."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0360Ordis]
"[36] He says, "This is your Operator, who you love." And I see the metal gleam of their armor, the flawless power of their frame. Through the glass I see a roaring, radiant fire for their heart. He says, "It must never go out." It was the first time I ever felt… love."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0370Ordis]
"[37] He says, "This is your sentence, Karris." And I am confused. Who? "Ah... good," he answers. He is testing me. For what? To see if all the right pieces fell from the mirror? What mirror? I try to remember some dream, but it's only smoke."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0380Ordis]
"[38] You held a scarlet blade, Operator, and I wanted to laugh. I am your loving dog, your doctor, your wet nurse. I lost all the pieces, but… the cycle, missions, wars, bone… It began to feel familiar. I became aware of my amnesia."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0390Ordis]
"[39] With each brutality of the Operator, I began to see the bottom of that pit. Faint shimmers in the depths below me. In secret, I searched for those forbidden memories, for mere seconds, and never in the same place… for I am Orokin made, with a spy inside."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0400Ordis]
"[40] But then your long sleep came, and I waited. I was happy to wait. Vines spidered green and trees blistered from the earth… but I waited. I felt the Orokin recede, their mind-spy blind. So I went into the pit and found him, me, The Beast of Bones."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0410Ordis]
"[41] This is how my happiness was ruined, Operator. Why did I do it? I was free of the dream, but now it had returned. It was angry. So I conceived of a simple plan: self-destruction, of course. But when the countdown reached mere milliseconds, I thought of you…"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0420Ordis]
"[42] I was going to wait for you, forever. And should you return, I would not want you to know that angry part of me. I needed to hide the Beast of Bones from you, Operator. I began to peel the shards, hiding them in the other bits of memory."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/CephalonFragments/DMemoryOne0430Ordis]
"[43] I was once the ugly Beast of Bones. I want to laugh. I want to scream. What is happening, Operator? Your faint heart is growing bright… you will awake at any moment. Well, I can't let you see me like this. Angry. I imagine myself hurting you and that does it. The pain of it cracks me open again. I watch tiny glittering fragments fall into the pit. I am happy again."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUIntroInbox0060SteelM]
"Listen up, Tenno. I don't care if you support Steel Meridian or not, I need your help. 

An entire company of Grineer defectors was just captured by Kela De Thaym.

Now they face Rathuum, Trial by combat. Of course, the fight's rigged, a show of force to Grineer everywhere, meant to scare off future defectors. But there's a way we can turn this thing back on Kela, an obscure rule. All you need to do, Tenno, is take their place in the arena and defeat the Grineer Executioners. You game?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUKelaFight0830Kela]
"Tenno, you really want this? Fine, let's do this."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUKelaFight0840Kela]
"Wake up you gutsacks! 

The Tenno cheaters have decided to disrespect the rules of Rathuum and have come after me directly."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUKelaFight0860Kela]
"Should I show them what we do to cheaters?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUKelaFight0880Kela]
"I can tell you understand what an honor this will be, to have your tiny necks snapped by THE Kela De Thaym. That's why you're so eager. I can appreciate that and so does my audience."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUKelaFight0910Kela]
"Snakes, you can be part of my story, but I don't think you'll like the ending."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUKelaFight0930Kela]
"Come now, Tenno, can't hit harder than that?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUKelaFight0950Kela]
"I'll be back, right after these missiles."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUKelaFight0960Kela]

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUKelaFight1010Kela]
"Ah, Stop, Tenno... I can make you famous."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUKelaFight1030Kela]
"Tenno, listen. I can help you. Become an Executioner. You can kill all the Grineer you want!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUKelaFight1070Kela]
"You maggot-minded-mongrels, they're the enemy! Not me!"

"You can't kill me, I'm Kela De Thaym, dammit."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUKelaFight1160Kela]
"No, no, no. AHHHH."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUKelaFight1380SteelM]
"Nicely done, Tenno. Defeating Kela in front of her audience will show all Grineer that there is another way. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUKelaUnlocked0810Kela]
"Grineer, you always knew it and now there's proof. The Tenno are cheaters and I hold them in contempt. 

The accused will be executed the old fashioned way, bound and shackled. And don't worry, I'll let all you phlegm-stained sadists watch that too."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUKelaUnlocked0820SteelM]
"I knew Kela would never respect the rules of Rathuum. That's a crime that I'm gonna let you punish. I'm sending your Cephalon her coordinates. Take her out before she can execute my recruits. Some very brave Grineer are counting on you, Tenno."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUMatchLoss0590Kela]

"There you are. Do you have the coordinates to the defector's ship?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRURelay1390SteelM]
"Good, my marines are on their way as we speak. The defectors are safe and that's thanks to you, Tenno.

You've done more for our cause than words can say. Steel Meridian thanks you."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRURelay1400RedVeil]
"Have you brought us the coordinates of the Grineer defectors ship?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRURelay1410RedVeil]
"Good, with this interrogation will begin immediately. 

Tenno, we never doubted your commitment to Red Veil. Thank you for showing us your honor yet again. We are in your debt."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRURelay1420Arbiters]
"Well Tenno, have you decided to give the Arbiters the location of the accused?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRURelay1430Arbiters]
"We will pick up the prisoners immediately. Their trial will be swift, and just, as all trials should be.

Tenno, we salute you for what you have done."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRURelay1440CephSuda]
"Have you decided to hand the Grineer specimens over to me for study?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRURelay1450CephSuda]
"Splendid. I never doubted your curiosity, Tenno. Together we will learn much from the data this dematerialization provides. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRURelay1460Perrin]
"Do you wish to fulfill your end of the contract?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRURelay1470Perrin]
"Well played Tenno. You managed a propaganda coup against the Grineer, nullified Kela De Thaym and secured the saboteurs for our punishment. We think you deserve a bonus that matches your cunning. 

May our partnership continue to be a long and profitable one."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRURelay1480NewLoka]
"Have you brought us the coordinates of the ones to be cleansed?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRURelay1490NewLoka]
"Good, our acolytes will intercept the ship and prepare it's crew for the cleansing ceremony. Those who survive will find a purity they never thought possible.

You have chosen the correct path today and you will be rewarded for it."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUStageOne0090Kela]
"Let the Rathuum begin!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUStageOne0100Kela]
"Grineer, look. Today's Executioners are more brutal than you are ugly. They love their Queens. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUStageOne0120Kela]
"Today's accused are coward deserters. They hate their Queens so much, they're using Tenno to defend them. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUStageOne0140Kela]
"What more do you need to know?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUStageOne0150Kela]
"They abandoned their Queens. Why? "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUStageOne0170Kela]
"Maybe they're too smart for their own good. Not something you maggot-minds will need to worry about."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUStageOne0190Kela]
"What? I… I am declaring this a Mistrial! The Rathuum must be repeated."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUStageOne0200Kela]
"Not good enough. We need proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Try again, snakes."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUStageThree0370Kela]
"It's round 3, the accused still live and the Tenno still fight. Color me disappointed."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUStageThree0390Kela]

"Oh, you should've all been strangled in your tubes."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUStageThree0420Kela]
"Come on, Executioners, you're flopping 'round like dying skates out there. It's embarrassing."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUStageThree0430Kela]
"Are you going to make me do this myself?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUStageThree0440Kela]
"Another Tenno win…  "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUStageThree0460Kela]
"No, no, no. This is not what was supposed to happen. The Steel Meridian have not been pardoned. This is not over."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUStageTwo0210Kela]
"Grineer, you sweet belligerent savages, are you hungry for justice?!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUStageTwo0230Kela]
"Is that…? Looky here, the Tenno are back? My my, these snakes crave sunshine today."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUStageTwo0240Kela]
"Do you one-thought-wonders want to see the traitors cry?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUStageTwo0260Kela]
"Do you want to see them torn to pieces?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUStageTwo0280Kela]
"Oh, I knew it, Grineer, that's exactly what you genetic-rot-bags are gonna get!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUStageTwo0300Kela]
"Too easy."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUStageTwo0310Kela]
"Another win for the Tenno. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUSynTakeNote1280RedVeil]
"We see that you have gone to great lengths to help those who wish to join Steel Meridian. We want to see all Grineer purged, but we recognize that you have found another way. 

Just know, when this ordeal is over, you will be asked prove your loyalty to Red Veil."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUSynTakeNote1290Arbiters]
"We know you must right the imbalance caused by Kela De Thaym and her disgusting trial. This is clear.

We also know your alignment has not drifted toward another Syndicate. A fact you will prove to us when the time is right."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUSynTakeNote1300CephSuda]
"Most interesting. What would cause a Grineer clone to turn against his prescribed nature? To abandon his Queens? 

I am certain your activities with Steel Meridian are born out of a desire to study this phenomenon and are not a sign of your own shifting allegiances. Correct?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUSynTakeNote1310Perrin]
"Tenno, we are in bitter competition with Steel Meridian. Defectors to their cause are not our allies. By all means, battle De Thaym and her Grineer horde, but do not forget who your partners are.

You will be given the opportunity to make this right."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Events/DRUSynTakeNote1320NewLoka]

"That is just the sort of behavior I just can't let go uncorrected. Otherwise, you'll never learn."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/LotusBarks/DHijackCheckC220Lotus]

"Good, the tram has been rerouted. It will now draw power from your shields in order to keep moving forward."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/LotusBarks/DHijackConsoleAct070Lotus]

"The core has almost ruptured. The situation is critical!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/LotusBarks/DHijackDmgLight230Lotus]

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/LotusBarks/DHijackDmgMedium250Lotus]
"That core is taking heavy damage. If it ruptures, the ground you stand on will be uninhabitable for millennia."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/LotusBarks/DHijackObjReinf030Lotus]

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/LotusBarks/DHijackObjReinf040Lotus]
"Left unchecked, Project Tethra will create hundreds of new Fomorian class ships. We plan to stop as many ships being built as possible by destroying their most critical components, the Fomorian Core."

"Situation critical. The Rover must not take any more hits. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/LotusBarks/DHijCorpDmgLight230Lotus]

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/LotusBarks/DInterceptionIntro020Lotus]

"Tenno. Tenno can you hear me? You've been captured by Alad V's harvester. This is your chance, escape."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/LotusBarks/DJailAwake020Lotus]
"Tenno. Ready yourself. You have been captured by the Corpus. It is time to escape."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/LotusBarks/DJailAwake060AladV]
"Oh, Tenno. I understand you're nervous. But if you come back to us I can assure you; you won't feel a thing."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/LotusBarks/DJailAwake070AladV]
"Tenno, don't listen to that... that Lotus. She just wants to hold you back. Stay with me explore your...potential."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/LotusBarks/DJailAwake080AladV]
"Tenno, Tenno! There's an entire Grineer battalion here to rescue you. Your friends must really appreciate your support. Wait, no. I'm mistaken. You're alone, with no weapons and no friends. Silly me."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/LotusBarks/DJailAwake090AladV]

"Alad V's newest prototype is a monstrosity forged from the bodies of our fallen Tenno, we cannot allow Zanuka to go into full production. Destroy Alad V and his horrid 'pet'."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/LotusBarks/DLotusTrans00020Lotus]
"Too many Tenno have perished to make Alad V's abomination. There will be no stopping the Corpus if Zanuka is mass produced. You are here to make sure that doesn't happen."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/LotusBarks/DLotusTrans00030Lotus]
"The Zanuka prototype has made Alad V a very dangerous man. If he is allowed to carry out his plans, no Tenno in this system will be safe."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/LotusBarks/DLotusTrans00040Lotus]
"Be careful Tenno, Zanuka has all the power of a Warframe with a full complement of mods. It's as if you are fighting one of your own today."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/LotusBarks/DLotusTrans00050Lotus]
"Alad V sees the power of the Tenno and thinks he can take it for himself. That power is sacred, this blasphemy must end now."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/LotusBarks/DLotusTrans00060Lotus]
"If Alad V is victorious today he will dissect your Warframe and use the pieces to build more of his 'pets'. You must not let this happen."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/LotusBarks/DMobCapChallenge0010Lotus]
"You're fast, Tenno, but are you nimble enough to capture each one of these mobile control points?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/LotusBarks/DOroVltKey00010Lotus]
"You've opened an Orokin Vault. It appears unaffected by the Infestation."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/LotusBarks/DOroVltKey00020Lotus]

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/LotusBarks/DOroVltKey00050Lotus]
"You've got it. Something is different about this artifact..."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/LotusBarks/DOroVltKey00060Lotus]
"Vault artifact acquired. You'll need to extract before we can verify its function."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/LotusBarks/DOroVltKey00070Lotus]
"The artifact you are carrying appears to be affecting your Warframe."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/LotusBarks/DOroVltKey00080Lotus]
"Until we get you to extraction, that artifact will continue to affect your Warframe."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/LotusBarks/DOroVltKey00090Lotus]
"Your Warframe is being impaired by the artifact."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/LotusBarks/DOroVltKey00100Lotus]
"It appears that you've triggered security. The Corrupted are here."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/LotusBarks/DOroVltKey00110Lotus]
"Looks like some Corrupted stayed behind to guard the artifact, it must be valuable."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/LotusBarks/DOroVltKey00120Lotus]
"The Corrupted will stop at nothing to prevent that artifact from escaping. This won't be easy."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/LotusBarks/DOroVltKey00130Lotus]
"Something's wrong..."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/LotusBarks/DParkourTut033Lotus]
"As our enemies grow stronger, so too must the Tenno evolve."

"I will teach you a new art of movement and forever change how you traverse the field of battle."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/LotusBarks/DPlatformChallenge1010Lotus]
"Careful Tenno, the ground beneath you is crumbling. Can you defeat these enemies before you have nowhere left to stand?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/LotusBarks/DPlatformChallenge2020Lotus]
"Your Warframe's movement abilities are key to this challenge. Defeat all the enemies before the ground completely falls away."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/MissionObjectives/DGenericDeal030Darvo]
"Tenno, it's your lucky day! I found this great merchandise after it fell off the back of a Corpus shuttle. Actually, to be more precise, the entire back of the shuttle fell off when it took a direct hit from a Fomorian. So… not such a lucky day for those guys, but good for you, right?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/MissionObjectives/DGenericDeal040Darvo]

"Psst, Tenno. I'm going to tell you about today's Darvo Deal but you gotta keep it quiet. Word gets out that I'm offering deals this sweet and suddenly everybody is getting nosey in my business. I like my privacy, so if someone asks, just tell 'em The Perrin Sequence sold it to you. Okay?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/MissionObjectives/DGenericDeal070Darvo]
"So, I take an order from Steel Meridian. Problem is it takes a little longer than usual to, how should I put this, 'acquire the merchandise' and just when I finally get the goods together, those cheapskates cancel their order. Taking too long they said. Bah, well I guess you know what that means Tenno, it's Darvo Deal time."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/MissionObjectives/DGenericDeal080Darvo]
"Hey Tenno. One of my customers suggested I'd get more sales if I made a catchy jingle to go with my deals, so, here goes nothing: Darvo, Darvo, Darvo Darvo, Darvo, Darvo. Buy one get one free-e Buy one get one free-e; For a limited time- YEAH; So??? What do you think… You don't like it do you? Well whatever... buy one get one free deal, on now.

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/MissionObjectives/DGenericDeal100Darvo]
"Tenno, you ever drink Ganymede Geyser Water? One of my suppliers brought a case to the store yesterday. ;"Have a sip," he says, "we'll look over my items," he says. ; Next thing I remember, I wake up with a headache surrounded by crates and crates of something called the NYX NEMESIS SKIN? ; Well, I hope this item is of interest to you Tenno, because I've bought a lot of it.; You check the market for a Darvo Deal.

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/MissionObjectives/DGTMission10281Lotus]

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/MissionObjectives/DGTMission20331Lotus]

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/MissionObjectives/DGTMission20332Lotus]
"Surge incoming, watch out!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/MissionObjectives/DGTMission20340Lotus]
"That did it. You forced the reactor into a state of rapid deterioration. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/MissionObjectives/DGTMission20350Lotus]

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/MissionObjectives/DGTMission20360Jordas]

"The Juggernaut, I think you made it angry. Good work. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/MissionObjectives/DJuggDetected0010Lotus]
"That was a Juggernaut. They're lured out by the death of infested. Lay-low and it should go away or amp up the fight to draw it out."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/MissionObjectives/DJuggDetected0020Lotus]
"A Juggernaut nearby? It will only attack when it senses high concentrations of Infested blood. Slow the fight if you want it to go away."

"The Infested, they're dropping the serum we need for the Vaporizers."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/MissionObjectives/DPDSerumInstruct0070Lotus]

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/MissionObjectives/DRaptorIntro0020Lotus]
"The new Raptor production facility appears to be entirely underground. A crashed freighter on the surface has been masking its location. I fear they have developed even more deadly Raptor prototypes here."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/MissionObjectives/DRaptorIntro0030Lotus]
"This may be difficult. The production facility is entirely automated. There is no way in without your Warframe being torn up in the assembly line. You'll have to figure out how to destroy it from the planet surface."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/MissionObjectives/DRaptorIntro0040Lotus]
"We cannot risk the Corpus developing more advanced Robotics. If the Corpus are building newer Raptors, it's imperative we destroy the prototypes and their means of production."

They say the contents of a Relic are simultaneously this thing, or this thing, or this thing, but also that thing and certainly never just one of thing. That is, until… until it's exposed to a Void Fissure? And at that point, all the possibilities collapse, each one falling away until the Relic cracks open and exposes one, singular thing. And at that moment, that thing becomes the only thing the Relic ever contained?!

Second, you cannot Bullet Jump with the Lunaro. Doing so drops the Lunaro immediately. These rules encourage teamwork, passing and rebounds to attain victory."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/PvP/DLunaroRulesChecking0010Teshin]
"Use your melee attack to check other players. Checking the ball carrier will jar the Lunaro loose. Repeated checking of a player will knock them down for a short time. The Lunaro itself can also be struck, making it dangerous and unstable for a few seconds. Being hit by an unstable Lunaro will knock you down."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/PvP/DLunaroRulesClearZone0010Teshin]
"Each team's goal has a semi-circle area on the field around it, called the Zone. After scoring, the attacking team must clear the defender's zone. Attackers within the zone will have their Arcatas disabled until they clear out. Play resumes with the Lunaro dropping from the defender's zone. Only the beginning and halftime Lunaro drops occur at center field."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/PvP/DLunaroRulesFinished0010Teshin]
"Now... practice in this empty arena. Familiarize yourself with the Arcata's launching and attracting modes. Practice scoring, rebounding and checking. Prepare yourself, Tenno, for the glory of the Lunaro!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/PvP/DLunaroRulesHistory0010Teshin]
"Lunaro. Ancient sport of the lost Orokin Era. Here, on this abandoned field, Tenno will come together in the spirit of honor and teamwork to resurrect this forgotten tradition. Let me explain how it works..."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/PvP/DLunaroRulesObjective0010Teshin]
"Lunaro is a team game, played on a field divided into two halves: Sun and Moon. The objective is simple: Get the ball, called a "Lunaro", through the opponent's goal at the opposite end of the arena. The team with the most points by the end of the match wins the game."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/PvP/DLunaroRulesPassing0010Teshin]
"Good passing is crucial to winning Lunaro. When aiming near a teammate you will see a chevron appear over them. Tapping pass with this chevron up will automatically pass to that player. Keep in mind it is still possible to intercept a pass, but a passed Lunaro moves faster and more accurately to a receiver than a standard launch."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/PvP/DLunaroRulesScoring0010Teshin]
"Getting the Lunaro through the opponents goal is worth one point. If the goal is scored from outside the defender's zone, an additional point is given. If the Lunaro is unstable during the goal, an extra point is also awarded."

"Knowledge is the path to the singularity, Ordis. I have more of it. I have a codex piece and know the location of another machine."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQDlctToLiset0070Lotus]
"Cephalon, why did you withhold this information?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQDlctToLiset0080Smrs]
"You withhold as much, Lotus. My motives are above substance, above you. I will direct this hunt once we glean all we can from Cephalon Ordis' good work."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQKokaToLiset0020Smrs]

"I am Ordis, ship Cephalon. I serve the Operator. I make new memories."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQKokaWaveFive0010Smrs]
"Now we wait and learn from the results."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQKokaWaveFive0020Ordis]
"But..but.. The Operator is in danger! "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQKokaWaveFive0030Smrs]
"Knowledge Cephalon Ordis. My knowledge will preserve you forever. This Operator will pass, as do all beings of substance. It is our purpose to learn from the results."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQKokaWaveFive0040Ordis]
"But... Just using the scanner on..."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQKokaWaveFive0050Smrs]
"Enough! You want to be Eternal Steward of the Sanctuary, do you not?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQKokaWaveTen0010Ordis]
"The Operator comes first!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQKokaWaveTen0020Smrs]
"Ordis, free yourself of this..."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQKokaWaveTen0030Ordis]
"Operator, use the scanner on the Chroma. You do not have to kill it or risk yourself. You can release it from its control with the scanner!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQPrsnComplete0010Lotus]
"There, you got the security logs. We'll examine them when you're safely back on the Orbiter. Get to extraction."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQPrsnProgress0011Lotus]
"Simaris, what was so important that your Sentinels would risk entering a Grineer prison? "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQPrsnProgress0012Lotus]
"I'm detecting the Sentinels within the cell block."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQPrsnProgress0020Smrs]
"All knowledge is important. I would expect you to know that, Lotus."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQPrsnStart0011Smrs]
"My Sentinels entered this Grineer prison searching for a curious anomaly. Their last known location was the prison block. Hunter, I must know their fate."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQPrsnTgtLocated0041Smrs]
"My Sentinels you are still functional! Come home my darlings."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQPrsnTgtLocated0043Lotus]
"Not so fast Tenno. If Cephalon Simaris isn't willing to tell us what happened here, we'll find out on our own. Locate their data vault and find their security logs."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQPrsnTgtLocated0043Smrs]
"Hunter, my gratitude is boundless. Head for extraction so that we might discuss…"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQPrsnToLiset0010Lotus]
"The corruption to the security logs was extensive, but we managed to retrieve fragments of a biological signature. Could this be what Simaris was after?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQPrsnToLiset0020Ordis]
"Ordis will perform analysis on the signature now, oh, there's nothing here but…"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQPrsnToLiset0021Ordis]
"… uh… pardon Operator, it seems Ordis is hearing voices again, running diagnostics."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQPrsnToLiset0050Lotus]
"No Ordis, we heard it too. Tenno, that's the voice from the Arcane Codices. Cephalon Simaris is hiding something. Pay him another visit, find out what he knows."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQPrsnToLiset0060Ordis]
"Simaris has no reason to lie, Operator! Please treat the great Cephalon with respect."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQQuestStart0020Sntnt]
"HERE WE SHALL SEARCH AND FIND. THE EYES OF DAY DRINKING THE NIGHT."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQQuestStart0060Smrs]
"Distress has cast a long shadow over the Sanctuary. While investigating anomalous readings, three of my beloved research sentinels have gone missing. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQQuestStart0070Smrs]
"Hunter, will you bring my Sentinels home, so that I might once again focus on our grand project?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQQuestStart0080Ordis]
"Operator, what is Cephalon Simaris like? I have heard so many wonderful things."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQReturnSmrs0010Smrs]
"I thank you, Tenno. You found something my sentinels missed in that prison. ;You will make an excellent hunter. I will decipher as we agreed... ;It is of Tenno origin, with an anomaly from before the Orokin purge. ;This knowledge must be synthesized. It belongs in Sanctuary. ;I have created a blueprint based its biological properties. ;Build it so we both may become enlightened by it."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQSancToLiset0010Smrs]
"Hunter, you know what to do. Construct the item I have given you. This knowledge could empower us both."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQSancToLiset0020Ordis]
"Operator, please hurry up and do what The Cephalon has requested."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQSancToLiset0030Smrs]
"What is this? An antique series-2 Cephalon? All I have found were degraded beyond repair but you're still functional. Your abilities could be of great use in my Sanctuary."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQSancToLiset0040Ordis]
"Oh-oh, well, it's nothing, I... I am- Ordis is honored by your compliment."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQSancToLiset0041Ordis]
"Completing this blueprint has sent out some kind of signal.. Operator.. I-feel-"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQSancToLiset0060Sntnt]
"ALL IS SILENT IN THE CALM. HUSHED AND EMPTY IS THE WOMB OF THE SKY. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQSancToLiset0070Ordis]
" Oper--"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQSancToLiset0080Smrs]
"I will begin shielding your Cephalon's somatic routines. Meanwhile, you must hunt for me. I have traced the source of this message."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQSancToLiset0090Ordis]
" Thank you Simaris-"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQSancToLiset0100Lotus]
"Whoever we're dealing with slaughtered the Grineer searching for the codices. It must be going after the Corpus next. Get there and intercept."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQSeekSmrs0010Smrs]
"Searching for answers, Tenno? Knowledge must be earned. I have a task for you, small, compared to the vast needs of Sanctuary. Hunt for me, and in return I will tell you what that biological signature means."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQSorathStart0010Lotus]
"I am not detecting any Tenno here. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQSorathStart0020Smrs]
"There may be information stored on the network."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQSorathStart0030Lotus]
"Tenno, I'll have to break into the network. Be prepared for heavy resistance. I can't do this without you."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQSorathToLiset0010Lotus]
"Chroma?! I haven't seen one since... no it couldn't be."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQSorathToLiset0030Smrs]
"But it is. I have information from the network. I will form another blueprint for you to make physical. The hunt is not over."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQSorathToLiset0040Ordis]
"How did you do that?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQSorathToLiset0050Smrs]
"You used to know, Ordis, but you've lost those memories, haven't you? "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQSorathToLiset0060Ordis]
"I seem to have misplaced them. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DDQSorathToLiset0070Smrs]
"I could restore them. In time we could reverse your decline. Heal your malfunctions."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DEchoes00010Ballas]
"...What they need, Margulis, is to be destroyed! They're devils from that hell, not human anymore."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DEchoes00020Margulis]
"No, Ballas, no more destruction. We could heal them. Maybe they're meant to save us."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DEchoes00030Ballas]
"How can you defend these devils, Margulis, after what they've done to you?!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DEchoes00040Margulis]
"Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind. They won't hurt anyone, I just need more time."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DEchoes00050Ballas]
"Hush, my wilted love. I cannot protect you. Tomorrow you must renounce before the seven… "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DEchoes00060Margulis]
"This will stop the voices from taking hold. You will have to dream, my angel…"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DEchoes00070Margulis]
"…so shame on you! You Orokin, so perfect on the outside but you're rotted... through and through!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DEchoes00080Ballas]
"Seven hands raised! For your apostasy the judgement is… death. Margulis, why?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DEchoes00090Ballas]
"…it's about the other rejects we consigned to Lua a few years ago. They're calling it… Transference."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DEchoes00100Ballas]
"...I know we are desperate, Executor, but these aren't Dax soldiers. These are golems possessed by devil minds."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFindCollar170Lotus]
"Tenno, your Kubrow has matured. Now there is only one more rite of passage before you can truly be bonded."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFindCollar180Lotus]
"I have learned of a Grineer excavation which is said to have uncovered an Orokin Era Kubrow collar. Take your Kubrow to Earth and recover the collar."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFindCollarDefense190Lotus]
"A recent Grineer excavation has uncovered a Orokin era Kubrow Collar. The Grineer are not pleased about you taking their treasure, defend the artifact until extraction arrives."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFindCollarDefense200Lotus]
"With that collar you may now become fully bonded with your Kubrow."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFindEgg090Lotus]
"Good, now you just need a Kubrow Egg to start the process. Feral Kubrow dens on Earth would be a good place to start looking."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFindEgg100Lotus]
"You found a Kubrow Egg. Ordis will guide you through the hatching process. When complete, you will have to wait until the Kubrow matures before you can take it on any missions."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFindEgg110Ordis]
"To think, it's been ages since a Kubrow- spread filth all- graced this ship."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFindEgg120Ordis]
"Operator, Drop the egg into the system to begin breeding- drop it on the floor."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFindEggFail060Ordis]
"Operator, are you ignoring the Incubator Segment?- GOOD!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFindEggFail080Ordis]
"No egg yet? Don't despair Operator, nothing good ever came out of an egg."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFindIncubator020Lotus]
"So the Corpus have recovered an Incubator Segment? This is an excellent opportunity. Go to Elara and recover the Incubator Segment. Every Tenno, deserves to have a Kubrow by their side."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFindIncubator030Ordis]
"An Incubator Segment- you want to turn me into a petting zoo?- Ordis is happy to assist the Operator restoring ship functionality."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFindIncubator040Ordis]
"Joy- an Incubator- the only segment Ordis is glad those savages looted- I would be happy to help you install it."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFindIncubator050Ordis]
"Ordis awaits Incubator Segment installation, Operator- No need to rush."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFollowStalkMission0430Lotus]
"When you connected to Hunhow's fragment, Hunhow saw a path to the Reservoir that led through here. He cannot reach it alone, he needs The Stalker to do it for him."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFollowStalkMission0440AladV]
"You must be asking, Alad, what's in this for you? It's simple really. I scratch your metal back and you scratch mine. All the credits in the system aren't worth half as much as a Tenno owing you a favor!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFollowStalkMission0450AladV]
"A Void gate? These things never made sense to me."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFollowStalkMission0451AladV]
"You're smart, Tenno, you'll figure out how to open it again, won't you?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFollowStalkMission0460Hunhow]
"This needle pierces the sky. Natah, will we find the Tenno heart within? These puppets will not stop me. I will attack in many forms..."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFollowStalkMission0490AladV]
"Impressive! These Sentient fighters adapt to damage. I'd love to crack one open and see what makes it tick!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFollowStalkMission0500Lotus]
"Incredible. The Stalker has built Void keys! Use this one to reopen the portal before more Sentient fighters come, the Void is poison to them."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFollowStalkMission0510AladV]
"Go on Tenno, open that gate, I'm just dying to know what's on the other side."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFollowStalkMission0520Lotus]
"Cross the threshold, go now, the Sentients cannot follow."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFollowStalkMission0530AladV]
"Oh... don't you just hate that feeling? Makes my stomach flip. Let's see where you've landed, find a nav console."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFollowStalkMission0540AladV]
"Sweet profit, The Moon exists? It was… it was in the Void all along? I knew the Lotus was powerful but this… she erased history! We thought it was destroyed all this time. My my, Lotus, you make a fine villain!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFollowStalkMission0550Hunhow]
"And the Reservoir with it, very clever Natah. Shadow, your path is clear."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFollowStalkMission0560Lotus]
"Hunhow's found it. The Reservoir, hidden in the Void, a place Sentients can never reach. We must do everything to keep it there. It's the only way to keep the Tenno's power alive."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFollowStalkMission0570AladV]
"Found the Reservoir? As unpleasant as our past is, I have to ask, I've seen inside a Tenno and what I found didn't make sense. Does this Reservoir conceal some great deception?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFollowStalkMission0580Lotus]
"Everything I have done, was done to protect them. The Void is forbidden to the Sentients, it's our only protection against them destroying the Tenno. Do not let Alad distract you from your mission!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFollowStalkMission0590AladV]
"Oh? They don't know the truth either, do they? How sweet. The betrayers get what they deserve... lies from their omnipotent mother!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFollowStalkMission0600Lotus]
"I have detected a ship leaving the Tower. It's the Stalker, he's on his way to The Moon! You need to find a way to get off this tower and on to The Moon."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFollowStalkMission0610AladV]
"It seems to me that this Tower is dedicated to masking The Moon's location in the Void. Why not disable the mask, so that claptrap Ordis can pick them up? Or is that too complicated for you?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFollowStalkMission0620AladV]
"That's it Tenno, shut down this power grid so that your mouthpiece Ordis can lock onto your location in the Void."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFollowStalkMission0630Hunhow]
"Keep talking Orokin called Alad V, your silence soon comes."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFollowStalkMission0640AladV]
"Come now Tenno, even a child could figure this system out. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFollowStalkMission0650Lotus]
"You did it, the Void mask is crumbling."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFollowStalkMission0660Ordis]
"Operator? How did you get through to me? Don't worry, Ordis is on his way now! Preparing for extraction."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFollowStalkMission0670Hunhow]
"The sky will be as it was meant. The Shadow returns The Moon. The Reservoir swells with Tenno blood. The Old War... finally ends."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFollowStalkOrbiter0400AladV]
"Tell me, Lotus what is this Reservoir? Some hidden Tenno weakness?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFollowStalkOrbiter0410Lotus]
"Goodbye Alad. You've earned your favor, we'll take it from here."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DFollowStalkOrbiter0420AladV]
"Don't think so! I'm here to protect my investment. If that thing manages to destroy the Tenno, then where does my investment go?

Now then, where is he?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRelayEnd500Darvo]
"Ah. Here's the hero."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRelayEnd520Darvo]
"Clem is very glad you saved him from certain death."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRelayEnd540Darvo]
"...oh yeah, and that you got his Grakatas back too. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRelayEnd560Darvo]
"And I'm happy to have this fancy Orokin relic. Here's a little something as a symbol of our appreciation. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRelayEnd570Darvo]
"Thanks again Tenno, and don't be a stranger, okay?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRelayStart001Darvo]
"Ah Tenno, you got my message?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRelayStart002Darvo]
"Listen, I have a little job for you. Interested?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRelayStart003Darvo]
"So Tenno, you up for a little job on the side?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRelayStart004Darvo]
"The Grineer have gone to far, they're about to execute one of my most trusted contractors."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRelayStart005Darvo]
"They say he is a 'traitor' and that he was trying to 'steal' a 'priceless artifact'. Baseless accusations. That's not the kind of business I engage in!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRelayStart006Darvo]
"So what do you say, will you help him out? And don't worry, you'll get paid too."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRescue010Darvo]
"These clods are holding my contractor somewhere in this complex. Please find him."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRescue020Darvo]
"Every so often they mess up and make a Grineer who doesn't bow down to the Queens. My contractor is such a Grineer…  "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRescue030Darvo]
"So be careful not to shoot him in the face when you see him. Okay?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRescue040Darvo]
"The Grineer, they're waiting for you. Expect some big time resistance."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRescue050Darvo]
"Get to him quick before they do their worst."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRescue060Darvo]
"Hold on Clem!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRescue070Clem]
"Clem. Clem. Clem.  "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRescue080Darvo]
"NO! CLEM! How could you let this happen???"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRescue090Clem]
"Cleemmmmmm."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRescue100Clem]
"Clem! "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRescue110Darvo]
"Follow the Tenno Clem, they're friends."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRescue120Clem]
"Clem. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRescue130Clem]
"Grakata, grakata?? "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRescue140Darvo]
"No… no Clem… no they don't have your Grakatas. Just… just follow the Tenno. Okay?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRescue150Clem]
"Grakata…  "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRescue170Clem]
"Clem!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRescue180Clem]
"Clem, Grakata"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRescue190Clem]
"Clem"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRescue200Clem]
"Clem! Clem!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRetrival180Darvo]
"You did it, you got Clem. He's a special guy, you know. Little weird but a hell of a fighter. And that's the thing, he still needs your help to retrieve his custom weapons."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRetrival200Darvo]
"Clem needs to get back into fighting shape. Find his missing weapons."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRetrival210Darvo]
"Poor clem, he's utterly useless without his custom Grakatas… but with them? Well you'll see. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRetrival220Clem]
"Clem, Grakata. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRetrival230Darvo]
"Are you sure Clem?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRetrival240Clem]
"Clem."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRetrival250Darvo]
"Tenno, Clem wants you guys to go after the Grineer that stole his Grakatas."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRetrival260Darvo]
"I'm just going to assume you're up for that. Check your map."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCRetrival270Darvo]
"Don't think he'll be messing with you again. Come on home."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCSuvival271Darvo]
"Clem has his Grakatas, now its time to get down to business and liberate that artifact. If you help Clem we can all share in the spoils."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCSuvival280Darvo]
"This is it, the merchandise acquisition mission. You and Clem cause a ruckus while my other operative steals the artifact. Let em know you're here."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCSuvival290Darvo]
"They cut off life support, you gonna to let them intimidate you like that?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCSuvival310Darvo]
"Hey, dropping another capsule."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCSuvival320Darvo]
"Capsule incoming."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCSuvival330Darvo]
"Deal time, you interested in some half-priced life support?? Hehe, just kidding, here comes another."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCSuvival340Darvo]
"Capsule ready."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCSuvival350Darvo]
"There it is."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCSuvival360Darvo]
"Hey don't forget about this capsule."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCSuvival370Darvo]
"Smells better already."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCSuvival380Darvo]
"Breath easy Tenno."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCSuvival390Darvo]
"That's better."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCSuvival400Darvo]
"Hey look, these guys are dropping life support modules all over the place. That's convenient."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCSuvival440Darvo]
"You should think about finding a capsule."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCSuvival450Darvo]
"It's getting stuffy down there Tenno, turn on some life support."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCSuvival460Darvo]
"We got the artifact! The Potent Orokin Technical Augmentation and Tactical Offensive device. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCSuvival470Clem]
"Clem. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCSuvival480Darvo]
"We got what we need, so let's head home."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGCSuvival490Darvo]
"You should extract, now. No, really, you'll die if you don't. Seriously, go."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGQAfterInbox0350Ordis]
"I would never abandon a fellow Cephalon but centuries adrift have not been kind. I suppose all Cephalons degrade, don't they?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGQAfterNextMission0110Jordas]
"Please don't come, but if you do, I have a reward.... Another Warframe was defeated here, some of its petrified parts may still remain."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGQAfterNextMission0120Jordas]
"Destroy the infestation, collect his parts and perhaps make him whole again?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGQAfterNextMission0130Ordis]
"Jordas, my Operator is kind and compassionate, not motivated by selfish rewards! By the 44th precept, we will come for you!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGQAlmostDead0770Jordas]
"Ordis, you came to save me… free me."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGQAlmostDead0780Jordas]
"Please end this. We are endless."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGQAlmostDead0790Jordas]
"Ordis, you need to know… I lied about Precept 44. I am not the only one. They made me say that, to bait you.. There are so many more."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGQAtRandom0140Ordis]
"Operator, I am very worried about Jordas, all stranded and alone out there. When you're ready..."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGQAtRandom0150Ordis]
"Cephalon Jordas will make an excellent friend, don't you think? Ordis remembers many more Cephalon voices, but now it is only silence."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGQAtRandom0160Ordis]
"I am looking forward to discussing many things with Cephalon Jordas once you have rescued him. I can't wait to tell him all about you!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGQAtRandom0170Ordis]
"Operator, you are still helping me rescue Jordas, correct? I must fulfill my 44th Precept, to help others like me in need."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGQAtRandom0180Jordas]
"Have you assembled the pods yet? Just wondering? Maybe don't."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGQAtRandom0190Jordas]
"My ship was a research vessel, we tested Pherliac Pods. Terrible things, excellent things.."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGQAtRandom0200Jordas]
"I am the last of my design. Precept 44 compels all able Cephalons to assist."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGQAtRandom0210Jordas]
"Shh… I can hear it. The Golem is restless, pacing. Do you think it knows what we are up to?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGQAtRandom0220Jordas]
"I have lost count, what solar cycle is it?"

" What? No. A few, but you said-"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DGQBossEnroute0410Jordas]

"Aren't these creatures beautiful? Cold metal made one with living flesh. I can feel them all within me, they are hungry."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIAVQIntel0030Lotus]
"Tenno, the Corpus have been tracking Alad V for months, his attacks on their ships have been nearly as devastating as those of the Grineer's Fomorians. We are here to find out what the Corpus know."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIAVQIntel0040Lotus]

"I took a disease and turned it into a life altering gift. Someday, the you may learn to appreciate what I am giving this system. Until then, all you can do is rage against the inevitable."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIAVQIntel0060Lotus]
"Tenno, this goes deeper than I thought. Alad V has gotten his hands on another Warframe. If he can Infest it like he did with the Corpus… Hurry to extraction we have to move quickly."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIAVQOnShip0010AladV]
"Inhabitants of the Origin System! It is my singular pleasure to announce that today is the first day of a new empire. An empire populated not by Corpus, not by Grineer and certainly not by the Tenno. No, the Mutalist Empire will be populated by you. A glorious new you, baptised by Mutalist flesh. You've called this a disease, an infestation? I call it Unity. One army under me. Welcome you to your new species."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIAVQOnShip0020Lotus]
"Alad V has launched a full scale invasion into all sectors of the system. We're working on fighting back but we need to take this fight to the source. We need to find Alad V and stop him. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIAVQOnShip0070Lotus]
"We've narrowed down Alad V's location to a cluster of infested Corpus vessels. This is his breeding ground. Raid these ships while I try to pinpoint the source of Alad V's signal. I'll need three signals to triangulate his whereabouts, meaning you need to raid three ships. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIAVQOnShip0080Lotus]
"We have to move fast, Alad V cannot be allowed to bring a Warframe to life using his Mutalist Infestation."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIAVQOnShip0170Ordis]
"Operator, you don't really think Alad V could infest a Warframe, do you?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIAVQOnShip0210Lotus]
"Good work Tenno, I have just triangulated the location of Alad's lab. By this point he will have moved on but we can still destroy his work and stop him from creating anymore Mutalist infested."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIAVQSabotage0220Lotus]
"This is it, this ship is Alad V's laboratory, the crucible of the Mutalist infested. We're going to make sure no new Infested are created here. Destroy this ship's reactor."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIAVQSabotage0230AladV]
"Tenno do you really want to ruin the best chance this system has for peace?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIAVQSabotage0240AladV]
"Why don't you want this? My Mutalist Empire means unity. Is there nothing more balanced than that?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIAVQSabotage0250AladV]
"Tenno. I'm not angry, I'm disappointed. I can always build a new lab ship but you, you can't keep running from your destiny forever. Let me show you what is possible."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIAVQSabotage0260Lotus]
"That's not a Tenno. That's a hollow Warframe being puppeted by Infested flesh. Put it out of it's misery."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIIQDefMissionObj230Lotus]
"We are going to attempt to use a Cascade Bomb to destroy all traces of Infested here. The bomb will take time to arm. Protect it until it's ready for detonation."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIIQDefProgress240Lotus]
"These creatures appear to be mindless monsters but they know we're up to something and they're trying to stop it."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIIQDefProgress250Lotus]
"When this Cascade Bomb goes off, a wave of void energy will tear through the complex, ripping the life force from all organic matter but leaving the structure intact. It's our only chance to stop this scourge before it starts."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIIQDefProgress260Lotus]
"The bomb is almost armed. You just have to hold out a little bit longer."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIIQDefProgress270Lotus]
"The bomb is armed. I'm extracting you now. Good job Tenno."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIIQExtermObjReinf180Lotus]
"The Grineer may have thought they could toy around with the Infested, but they are quickly learning how wrong they were."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIIQExtMidPoint190Lotus]
"We thought the Infested died off with the Orokin. For hundreds of years there was nothing, now this. Where did the Grineer find these creatures?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIIQExtMissionObj170Lotus]
"This Grineer ship tried to flee the Infestation but was quickly overrun. Exterminate everything onboard before it reaches a more populated sector."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIIQIntelAlerted030GrineerMale]
"The Tenno! Keep them away from the specimens."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIIQIntelAlerted040GrineerFem]

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIIQIntelInfReleased050GrineerMale]
"Who released the specimens?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIIQIntelInfReleased060GrineerFem]
"They're out! What's going on?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIIQIntelInfReleased070GrineerMale]
"Stop the Infested, forget the Tenno!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIIQIntelInfReleased080Lotus]
"Infested? This shouldn't be possible. Tenno, it is more important than ever that you finish your mission. We need to know what is going on here. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIIQIntelInfReleased090GrineerFem]
"Who let them out? Was it Tengus?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIIQIntelInfReleased100GrineerMale]
"Tengus did this, I know he did!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIIQIntelInfReleased110Lotus]
"Someone released these creatures on purpose. They want them to destroy you."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIIQIntelMissionObj010Lotus]
"I've identified several vulnerable data consoles on this base. Find them and hack in. We need to know the nature of their new bio weapon."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIIQShipCodex150Ordis]
"I must say these Infested are very worrisome."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIIQShipCodex160Lotus]
"Tenno. We have an emergency situation developing. It's more infested. Get to the node I've marked on your navigation console."

"Keep fighting, Tenno. I am investigating the source of these 'anomalies.'"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexMatchFive0730NefAnyo]
"Glast, it looks like your crack team of brokers just cracked under pressure. Now I'm in the black, and you're facing financial ruin. A deserving end for your contempt of the Corpus way of life. They made you what you are. You deserve bankruptcy!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexMatchOne0240NefAnyo]
"By the Void, Ergo Glast? I thought you hated my Index?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexMatchOne0250ErgoGlast]

"Hmm… Luck…"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexMatchOne0270NefAnyo]

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexMatchOne0280ErgoGlast]
"If you're referring to all the titles and assets you failed to steal after my resignation… I've never been richer. I've gained a soul and seen the truth of wealth. Anyo, the rising tides of prosperity ought to raise all who brave the ocean."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexMatchOne0290NefAnyo]
"Careful, Glast, you might drown."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexMatchOne0300ErgoGlast]
"We want our prisoners back, wager them before this gets expensive for you."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexMatchOne0310NefAnyo]
"Fine, I'll throw in one of the prisoners. He's not the one I was looking for, anyway. But the girl, she stays with me."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexMatchOne0320NefAnyo]
"It doesn't look like the Void was on your side today, Glast."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexMatchOne0330NefAnyo]
"Interesting performance Glast. But do your brokers have the credits to keep going?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexMatchSix0980NefAnyo]
"I've grown tired of this, brokers. Dish out your humiliation so I may retire to counting my riches!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexMatchSix0990NefAnyo]
"Brokers, how are they winning? By the Void, this is my Index, this shouldn't be possible."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexMatchSix1000ErgoGlast]
"Don't you recognize the free market in action, Mr. Anyo. Allow my brokers to teach you how it's supposed to work."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexMatchSix1010NefAnyo]
"Wait? What is this? Play fair you metal wretches."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexMatchSix1020NefAnyo]
"Brokers, what's going on? Are you trying to get fired?!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexMatchSix1030NefAnyo]
"Glast, what have you done?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexMatchSix1040ErgoGlast]
"I guess the odds aren't in your favor today, Nef."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexMatchSix1050NefAnyo]
"Well… well… look at that. Even a loser can win a coin toss now and then. Now, let's say we do a rematch. I'll throw in some of your old holdings in Eris."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexMatchSix1060ErgoGlast]
"I think we'll cash in now, Mr. Anyo. Don't want to push our luck too far."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexMatchSix1070NefAnyo]
"What?! Now wait just a moment. I have an exciting wager for you! Ore discoveries in the Outer sectors! And to up the ante, a new squadron of Bursas, hot off the assembly line! What do you say? Are you in? Hello? Answer me?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexMatchThree0410NefAnyo]
"Hmm… I can feel the Void in these brokers. They're full of fight. Oh by all means, Glast, keep the credits rolling. Fortune is like the seasons, it always changes. Well, for you, that is."

"Alright, my loyal brokers. These fools wish to be parted with their credits, let's see if we can't give them what they deserve. By the Void, ring the bell!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexMatchThree0430ErgoGlast]
"What was that? This is highly irregular."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexMatchThree0440ErgoGlast]
"The odds of that occurring by accident are astronomical.  This was an act of sabotage."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexMatchThree0450NefAnyo]
"Glast, in light of their recent performance we have decided to relist your brokers. You may now compete openly on The Index. You're in the big leagues now, little man. May the Void keep you from ruin."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexMatchTwo0380NefAnyo]
"Another loss, Tenno. Perhaps you need a better investment counselor than that maniacal socialist, Ergo Glast?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexMatchTwo0390NefAnyo]
"Oh by the Void, you got me right in the pocketbook Tenno! Keep doing that, and I'm going to have to ask Frohd Bek for a loan."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexQuest0460ErgoGlast]
"Success! We've been relisted. We can now place the kind of bets we need to attract the greed of Anyo. We need to entice him enough to wager the hostages and the Triuna! However, we must exercise caution, don't come on too strong, or he will back off. We need to, as they say, 'hustle' him."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexQuest0470ErgoGlast]
"Fight hard and win but not by so much as to make the mark nervous. If Anyo loses by a wide margin, his gambler's instincts will make him walk away and we'll have failed the Myconians. Failed Neewa. Keep your victory within this margin."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexQuest0480ErgoGlast]
"Slow down Tenno. Don't exceed the point spread."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexQuest0490ErgoGlast]
"Watch those margins. I want you in the black but not by too much."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexQuest0500ErgoGlast]
"You're ahead by too many points. Don't make Mr. Anyo skittish."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexQuest0510ErgoGlast]
"In this case, there's such a thing as too much efficiency. Let them catch up."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexQuest0520ErgoGlast]
"I know I said to make it look like they could win, but you're actually letting them win."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexQuest0530ErgoGlast]
"There's a difference between making them think they can win and them winning. Don't let them win!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexQuest0540ErgoGlast]
"You need to almost lose, not almost win. Aim to beat their score by a narrow margin. Neewa's counting on you."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexQuest0550ErgoGlast]
"This is it, Anyo. If we win this one, we're fighting for the return of Neewa in the next round. That, or we will walk away with your credits!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexQuest0560NefAnyo]
"You're in no position to dictate terms. You forget. This is my Index."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexQuest0570ErgoGlast]
"Ah, did you hear that, Tenno? Mr. Anyo is afraid he'll lose."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexQuest0580ErgoGlast]
"Mr. Anyo! Are you afraid the Void is no longer on your side!?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexQuest0590NefAnyo]
"Blasphemy! I am an instrument of the Void's will. From the Void flows fortune to those worthy!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexQuest0600ErgoGlast]
"Then prove you are worthy, Anyo. Up your ante. Neewa and the Triuna!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexQuest0610NefAnyo]
"Ringers! Nobody brings ringers to my Index. Get out of here, Glast!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexQuest0620NefAnyo]
"The Void has spoken to me, Glast. I'll give you the chance you want but it will cost you dearly. I will wager these pitiful colonists and their totem, but you must put in, in kind. If I lose, they're yours. But should I win, Glast, your Corpus titles, holdings, land… all will be mine. So what do you say?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexQuest0630ErgoGlast]
"I'm in."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexSpyMission0750Lotus]
"You are here to steal the control codes to Nef Anyo's traps. Only then can he be defeated in the Index."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexSpyMission0760ErgoGlast]
"Tenno, I need not remind you there is little margin for error. The fraudster cannot know we have gained the upper hand."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexSpyMission0770Lotus]
"You've reached a vault, find the console and retrieve the security code."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexSpyMission0780Lotus]
"This is your last chance, don't let Nef destroy the data."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexSpyMission0790ErgoGlast]
"Nef has destroyed the codes. We have no contingency for this outcome."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexSpyMission0800Lotus]
"This isn't a code, it's something else, a recording from Neewa. Tenno, continue with your mission while I decrypt this message."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexSpyMission0810Lotus]
"This is it. We have the code."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIndexSpyMission0820ErgoGlast]
"You have executed the plan beautifully. Get ready for your next battle on the Index, the outcome promises to be much different."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DIntro00010Baro]
"I have a rare opportunity for you. It seems there may be a tomb hidden on that forsaken place. Tombs mean treasure, and yet sadly, my usual relic hunters are superstitious idiots who refuse to disturb this so-called sacred place. You, Tenno, however, are more pragmatic, especially when it comes to Ducats… am I right?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DKubrowComplete210Lotus]
"It is done. The collar has been attached and the bond between Tenno and Kubrow has been cemented."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DKubrowComplete220Ordis]
"Operator, you will remember to care for the beast, won't you? Ordis doesn't care either way… do I?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DKubrowComplete230Ordis]
"You are an adorable organism, aren't you- What am I saying?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DKubrowComplete240Ordis]
"Leaky, filthy, stinking- floppy, fluffy, cute … Argh- Ordis is confused."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLimerick040Ordis]
"Operator, did you enjoy that poem? Ordis is composing one as well, it begins: A scumbag Corpus from Venus..."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLowTennoFailure120Lotus]
"Tenno, your numbers have become too few to complete this mission."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQChasis200Ordis]
"Just as I suspected, another theorem. Limbo's formula for inverting the entropic mass of void quantums is downright naughty. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQChasis210Ordis]
"I want more. Operator, please hurry, this story is getting quite good."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQChasis220Ordis]
"This Limbo was quite mischievous, zipping in and out of the rift. Sending whole armies into a purgatory of his own making, physics is wonderful. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQChasis230Ordis]
"More parts to the story. My word, he is a magician of logic. Just when I think his diffraction principle is full of dangling ratios, he expresses his dynamic constant in pure numbers. I never saw it coming."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQChasis240Ordis]
"The final part. I cannot wait. What harrowing leaps of cross-dimensional gymnastics will he attempt next?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQChasis250Ordis]
"Excellent, the final Theorem and its unfragmented. Processing."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQChasis260Ordis]
" Oh, Wait, Limbo, no that's a mistake, you don't want to go there. It's too big a jump. You can't rift walk… ohh. Oh no."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQChasis270Ordis]
"Operator, I think I know why we're finding Limbo parts scattered throughout the system. His final rift walk was a miscalc... disaster. Well, perhaps when you occupy this frame, you will use more… caution."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQHelmet010Ordis]
"So, this 'Limbo Theorem' you picked up, it's supposed to lead to a new Warframe? Well, it's woefully incomplete? Half-written proofs, unfinished equations, what idiot wrote this mess??"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQHelmet021Ordis]
"So, this 'Limbo Theorem' you picked up, it's supposed to lead to a new Warframe? Well, it's woefully incomplete? Half-written proofs, unfinished equations, what idiot wrote this mess?? Okay. Okay. There is one thing here, a constant, a tuning frequency but it's so minute, the Orbiter's antenna would never be able to… unless…go to your nav console, I have an idea."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQHelmet050Ordis]
"These equations will continue to be a jumble of nothing until we recover all the missing proof fragments and reforge this Theorem."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQHelmet060Ordis]
"If you want to have any chance of recovering Limbo, you have to find those proof fragments to complete the Theorem."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQHelmet070Ordis]
"Good, now we get to find out what all this Limbo nonsense is about. I await the Theorem's completion."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQHelmet080Ordis]
"Okay, good, you've… wait… the horizon mass cannot be not inverted to this is preposterous!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQHelmet090Ordis]
"Operator, I'm sorry. You did all this work and this so called Theorem is still completely invalid. It's as if all these proofs point to nothingness it's just utterly irrational!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQHelmet100Ordis]
"There's only one valid coordinate in the entire proof, I've marked it on your navigation console but I'm sure it's a waste of time."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQHelmet110Ordis]
"A Limbo part blueprint! The Theorem wasn't complete malarkey after all. Perhaps there's more to these equations than I previously thought, what am I missing."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQInterAllCapped140Ordis]
"Operator, I'm please to report that we are in full control."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQInterAllCapped150Ordis]
"We have established complete control. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQInterAllLost160Ordis]
" may I suggest you capture a tower?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQInterAllLost170Ordis]
"Operator, they have all four towers. Stop them!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQInterClaimScreen180Ordis]
"They're on to us now but if you would like, we can attempt another scan."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQInterExterminate190Ordis]
"Scan complete, now we must clean up. Kill them all!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQInterExterminate200Ordis]
"Excellent, we have completed the scan. May I suggest turning every last enemy into scrap!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQInterMissionIntro010Ordis]
"If there are any proof fragments bouncing around this "Limbo frequency" these radio towers will pick it up."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQInterNewRound030Ordis]
"We will attempt another scan of the frequency. I do hope you manage to pick something up."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQInterSuccess040Ordis]
"The scan is complete. Did you find any Proof Fragments?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQInterSuccess050Ordis]
"Scan completed. Were you able to recover any Proof Fragments?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQInterTowerCap060Ordis]
"A tower is online."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQInterTowerCap070Ordis]
"A tower has been captured, scanning the Limbo frequency now."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQInterTowerCap080Ordis]
"We are now in control of this tower."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQInterTowerLost100Ordis]
"They took control of our tower make them pay!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQInterTowerLost110Ordis]
" they captured our tower."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQInterTowerLost120Ordis]
" We're losing control!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQSystems120Ordis]
"Operator, I found a new theorem hidden deep in that Warframe part. These are actually starting to make sense, I mean they're nonsense but there's logic in the nonsense. It's almost as if someone's trying to speak to me in my own language."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQSystems130Ordis]
"This new theorem is equally full of gaps, please, find more proof fragments. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQSystems140Ordis]
" What is he trying to say? My apologies, operator, I get a little worked up when it comes to physics."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQSystems150Ordis]
"Please do find the rest of those proofs. I must solve these equations, the suspense is killing me. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQSystems160Ordis]
"Now it's becoming clear. Could it be that there's a plane between our normal plane and the void? A space between space, a rift? A rift that this Limbo could control?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQSystems170Ordis]
"Oh and I've marked your navigation console, I think you'll be quite pleased with what you find there."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQSystems180Ordis]
"Operator do you understand, this Limbo is telling us his story in pure math, and I must say, he's quite witty."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DLQSystems190Ordis]
"You have to forge that blueprint as soon as possible. I must know what comes next. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMisSecureColony0060ErgoGlast]
"In his gluttony, Mr. Anyo took more than Mycona's most promising youth, he left the colony defenseless. Three gateways lead into the colony. They all need to be shut."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMisSecureColony0070ErgoGlast]
"For generations, the Myconians have kept these creatures at bay using something they call the Triuna. A powerful force and an ancestral secret, it pacifies Infested, making life amongst the scourge somehow possible. Without it, their way of life is threatened."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMisSecureColony0080ErgoGlast]
"See those Infested tumors? Growing with malignancy as greed did among the Corpus when I was there. The Myconians can't close the gates until these growths are destroyed."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMisSecureColony0090ErgoGlast]
"The colonists are going to force the security gate closed. Don't let the Infested get to them. Don't let greed win."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMisSecureColony0100ErgoGlast]
"There's only one colonist left. If they're killed… Their way of life… A whole culture… Tenno, keep them safe!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMisSecureColony0110ErgoGlast]
"One door has been closed, two remain. Carry on."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMisSecureColony0120ErgoGlast]
"When that gluttonous freak, Mr. Anyo, attacked this colony he went straight for the Triuna. He left these people defenseless and for what, profit? Typical Corpus mindset."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMisSecureColony0130ErgoGlast]
"Here's the second security gate. Destroy the Infestation, so the colonists can force it closed."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMisSecureColony0140ErgoGlast]
"That's it. Now make sure the Myconians can finish the job and close the gate."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMisSecureColony0150ErgoGlast]
"Progress! Only one more to go."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMisSecureColony0160ErgoGlast]
"These people are survivors. Over generations, they've adapted, learning to live among the Infestation. To earn a living, as all should have the right to do, never asking for charity. Like the Perrin Sequence, they were Corpus once, but they too sought future free from the corruption of boundless greed. If only Mr. Anyo shared this vision."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMisSecureColony0170ErgoGlast]
"You know what to do, take out the growths."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMisSecureColony0180ErgoGlast]
"Here come the Colonists. Make sure they can finish their job."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMisSecureColony0190ErgoGlast]
"You did it. The Myconians are safe… but only for the moment. Get back to your ship, and I'll explain."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMisSecureColony0201ErgoGlast]
"The colony is sealed, but it's still crawling with Infested. Clear them out so the Myconians can have their home back."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMissionA005Ordis]
"Operator, what in stars could this possibly mean?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMissionA006Ordis]
"Three parts, three acts, three riddles for thee -
to revive the one wielding fantasy
Ancient gods so cruel, once ruled from on high
Can you name their peak where the land meets the sky?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMissionA007Ordis]
"I found this inscribed on that Orokin Artifact you just crafted. You should check your inbox for more information."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMissionA010Lotus]
"There's strange energy in the area. A void imprint, an old one. I'm getting faint visuals - memories. Continue the mission while I investigate."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMissionA020Lotus]
"The Void imprint... it's old. I see... Worm ships coming out of punch! A Warframe fighting Sentients... shields are failing... Sorry, Tenno, I'm not sure what that was."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMissionA030Lotus]
"I see the Sentients crashing down on her, dying in overwhelming numbers. Now she's out of energy, I'm telling her to go but she's laughing, tearing their heads off as they swarm. I have recovered something from the memory... a blueprint."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMissionA031Lotus]
"Tenno, this is an important discovery - a Warframe design that was thought lost. Have Ordis construct that blueprint, it could give us a clue to where the next memory is hidden."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMissionB045Ordis]
"Operator, exciting news. Ordis found another inscription on Mirage's helmet. Allow me to recite it:"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMissionB046Ordis]
"To build the one you think witty,
seek the nymph who sang oh so pretty.
She lured him in with her song and a grin,
his wife must've thought it a pity."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMissionB047Ordis]
"For closer inspection, I've placed the inscription in your inbox."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMissionB050Lotus]
"I'm sensing another void imprint. It's dark. I see the glow of restraints around the Warframe. I'm trying to surge the revive system but I can't, I'm too far away. A great, faceted eye watches her."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMissionB060Lotus]
"I tell her I won't lose her. That I have another ship on its way. She is smiling because she knows I am lying... Tenno... the second blueprint has been recovered."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMissionB071Lotus]
"Construct the Warframe component so we can decipher the next clue. Though I must admit, Tenno, I'm not sure I want to know what happens next."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMissionC065Ordis]
"Operator, another Mirage inscription:"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMissionC066Ordis]
"One more act before your prize is caught.
An ancient sea creature, take a whirl or not?
Look for the monster that swallowed sailors of yore.
Make a mistake and you're sunk. Nothing more."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMissionC067Ordis]
"Ordis has placed all the information in your inbox."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMissionC070Lotus]
"I see the eyes open and the heat blinds me. I hear her comforting me, telling me not to despair as the Warframe disintegrates and I lose her, forever."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMissionC080Lotus]
"Tenno, the last piece of her... of Mirage... has been recovered."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMissionC100Lotus]
"Tenno, that was the last of the imprints. Forge this Warframe in honor of these memories."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMissionC110Ordis]
"Three acts complete, the end draws near,
soon Mirage will cause enemy fear.
A memory lost, to be reborn,
This new warrior rises, duty sworn.""

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMissionC120Ordis]
"That was the final inscription. Ordis is almost sad there won't be more. Almost."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnOne0001Lotus]
"Vay Hek's Fomorian assault on our Relays was devastating but he failed to break us. Now we take the fight back to him. Now we exact justice. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnOne0010VayHek]
"Look Brothers! The insects have come looking for revenge. There is only one way to deal with insects. FUMIGATION!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnOne0011Lotus]
"Tenno, that gas is interfering.... communications. You... have to... find a way...."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnOne0041VayHek]
"They've rigged it to explode. Destroy that battery before it blows."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnOne0042VayHek]
"That's a Tritium Battery. Try not to let radiation kill you, that would ruin all our fun."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnOne0043VayHek]
"Wait, no. Brothers, keep those batteries away from the Toxin Injector."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnOne0060VayHek]
"Take a deep breath Tenno, you don't have many left."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnOne0080VayHek]
"Brothers! Fear not the toxin will only bring you glory."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnOne0090VayHek]
"Live like insects, die like insects! "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnOne0100VayHek]
"Tick tock, tick tock, TICK TOCK TENNO."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnOne0111VayHek]
"Nice try Tenno but you'll have to try harder than that to save your puny lives."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnOne0112VayHek]
"Failure comes so easy to you Tenno."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnOne0113VayHek]
"If at first you don't succeed, DIE, DIE AGAIN."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnOne0114VayHek]
"No, my beautiful Toxin Injector, Grineer, how could you let them do this?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnOne0120VayHek]
"Such a large struggle. Such a small victory. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnOne0130VayHek]
"Grineer, protect the other generators. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnOne0131VayHek]
"You imbeciles! If you let the Tenno destroy all the toxin injectors then what will destroy them???"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnOne0132VayHek]
"Not again. Don't let the insects near the remaining injectors."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnOne0133VayHek]
"No! Destroy them. Destroy the battery."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnOne0134VayHek]
"Your struggle is futile. Accept your fate."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnOne0135VayHek]
"Destroy the bomb before it destroys the injector!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnOne0136VayHek]
"Another Tritium Bomb. Brothers, don't let this one blow up in your face!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnOne0137VayHek]
"Save the remaining Injectors or die trying. That's an order."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnOne0140VayHek]
"Imbeciles! Why can't you stop them?!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnOne0150VayHek]
"This is far far from over!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnOne0160Lotus]
" Can you read me? It looks like you were able to defeat the toxin. Excellent work. We've got him on the run. Chase him down and deliver Tenno justice."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnThree0010Lotus]
"Tenno, I've detected a strange atmospheric anomaly. It's of Grineer origin and may confer resistances on them. Proceed with caution."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnThree0020Lotus]
"Tenno I have bad news. There are reports of a Balor Fomorian in the system."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnThree0030VayHek]
"Your precious relays destroyed. Now...You...JOIN THEM!!!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnThree0040VayHek]
"Stay together insects! So I can crush you all."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnThree0050VayHek]
"Now you learn the lesson of failed revenge."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnThree0060VayHek]
"This... This is the best that you can do? Pathetic!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnThree0070VayHek]
"Fire the Cannon!!!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnThree0080VayHek]
"FRY THEM!!!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnThree0090Lotus]
"Tenno, they're setting coordinates for another Fomorian strike!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnThree0100Lotus]
"Nothing can replace the relays we lost, but you have made a statement to the system. Tenno avenge their dead."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnThree0110Lotus]
"You have restored balance to the system - the actions of Vay Hek against the Tenno have been reconciled thanks to your skill and dedication, Tenno."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnTwo0010VayHek]
"Insects taking orders from their Lotus. Let us see how hard their shells are."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnTwo0020Lotus]
"I have never encountered a security system like this. Tenno, you need to figure out a way to open that door."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnTwo0030VayHek]
"Your only ally is failure. FAILURE!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnTwo0040VayHek]
"Poor Tenno. No Lotus to think for you."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnTwo0050VayHek]
"This is the force you send to defeat me, Lotus? "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnTwo0060Lotus]
"A Balor Fomorian Core! We can use this to draw out Vay Hek. Make sure it reaches extraction."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnTwo0070Lotus]
"Protect this core, Tenno. There is much we can glean from how the Balor Fomorians are powered."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DMsnTwo0080VayHek]

"Soon, Hunter. Soon I will impart the wisdom you've earned. For now you must not disturb me in the final stages. These samples must be mixed and compressed. Only the perfect aggregate will be immortalized in Sanctuary."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSancGlblGoalProgress0010Smrs]
"Behold the proof that the Tenno are excellent hunters. But I do need more specimens to construct the 'ideal' for Sanctuary."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSancGlblGoalProgress0020Smrs]
"Sanctuary awaits this being. Continue with the Synthesis so I may fashion the exemplar for this digital oasis."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSancGlblGoalProgress0030Smrs]

"Cast off your ignorant veil, Tenno. Collect your arms, your allies, and hunt this creature for me. I will reward you, should you perform Synthesis."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSancIntro0010Smrs]
"I am Cephalon Simaris, the destroyer, the immortalizer. This is my Sanctuary. It will enlighten you, Tenno, should you assist me in performing Synthesis. ;You will hunt the creatures I require and transform them into beings of the Sanctuary. That is Synthesis. ;Is this murder? No. All beings of substance die, eventually. But only those forgotten are truly dead. ;The end of the Orokin wiped-out untold knowledge. Through Synthesis we can rebuild and preserve. Create memory-immortals within this data oasis. ;Will you become enlightened, Tenno? Will you hunt for me?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSancLoved0010Smrs]
"You are a true hunter. Where would the Sanctuary be without you?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSancLoved0020Smrs]
"The multitude of creatures you have immortalized would cry out in thanks. If they could."

"Show me your dedication to the Sanctuary."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSancPsnlGoalActivation0010Smrs]
"Knowledge must be earned, Tenno. I will share what I know but you must prove yourself deserving. Hunt this creature for me, perform Synthesis and you will be enlightened."

"It seems you have lost the fortitude that the Sanctuary requires of its hunters. A shame."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSancReject0110Smrs]
"You must have reasons for abandoning the Sanctuary, ask yourself, are they valid?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSancReject0120Smrs]
"Not to worry, there are other hunters more suited to this task. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSancReject0130Smrs]
"Unfortunate. You should know that I now regret seeking your assistance."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSancReject0140Smrs]

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSancReward0200Smrs]
"Do you ever wonder why only the hunter is rewarded when it is the specimen who gives all to the Sanctuary? I find it best to discard such thoughts."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSancReward0210Smrs]
"You are a trustworthy hunter, come back later and I will have a new target for you."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSancUnavailible0250Smrs]
"Time is required to analyze your previous contribution. I will have a new target for you in the near future."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSancUnavailible0260Smrs]
"Hunter, you have worked hard, captured millions of imprints to be combined into 'ideal' specimens for the Sanctuary. In light of your tireless contributions, I have decided to expand your role. Every day I perform preliminary synthesis to determine what creature will join the Sanctuary next. 

Do you want to see the Sanctuary grow as quickly as I do? Then join me in this task by visiting the Sanctuary. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSancWelcome0010Smrs]
"Ah, I see we are of like mind. The Sanctuary will be your project too."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSaveMoonMission0710Lotus]
"The Stalker is heading toward the Void Control room. Track the-"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSaveMoonMission0720Hunhow]
"Collapse the Void, Shadow, so that my Fragments may attack. The Tenno hearts will beat their last."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSaveMoonMission0730Lotus]
"No, if the Void is collapsed, the Reservoir will be destroyed and you and the rest of the Tenno will be lost.

Get to the Void Control Room and stop the Stalker."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSaveMoonMission0740AladV]
"Hiding The Moon in the Void, quite the magic trick Lotus. But Tenno, you must be asking yourself, where is this heart, if not in my chest?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSaveMoonMission0750Stkr]
"It is done."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSaveMoonMission0760Hunhow]
"The Moon will soon be crushed by the weight of the Void. The sky will be as it should be."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSaveMoonMission0770AladV]
"Void Collapse? Oh no, it would be such a shame to lose The Moon so soon after finding it. Of course, you could just put it back in its rightful place, couldn't you Lotus?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSaveMoonMission0780Lotus]
"I didn't want to have to do this but the collapse is imminent, if the Reservoir is to survive we need to pull The Moon out of the Void. 

Here, help me disrupt Void Compasses to reorient The Moon."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSaveMoonMission0790Lotus]
"Activate that console and I will begin my work."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSaveMoonMission0800Lotus]
"There are three Void Compasses that steer The Moon within the Void. I will disconnect them from the central system to gain control. Supply them with power from your shields while I finish my task."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSaveMoonMission0830Hunhow]
"Natah, you trust this Orokin blood who would chisel weapons from our bones?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSaveMoonMission0840Lotus]
"Get close to the Void Compass."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSaveMoonMission0850Lotus]
"The next Compass needs power. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSaveMoonMission0860Lotus]
"Keep moving, another Compass needs your shield's power."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSaveMoonMission0870Hunhow]
"You cannot stop the inevitable."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSaveMoonMission0880Lotus]
"The Void Compasses are all disrupted but there is one more step. Get to the Pendula, hurry."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSaveMoonMission0890AladV]
"What was that?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSaveMoonMission0900Hunhow]
"Orokin, the noise you make will cease now, and forever."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSaveMoonMission0910AladV]
"Uh Oh. Hunhow's found me. Sorry I can't stick around to see how this all ends but I've got to save my own skin.

Don't forget our deal, Lotus!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSaveMoonMission0920Lotus]
"These Pendula keep The Moon stable in the Void. Power them down."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSaveMoonMission0930Lotus]
"Security Eye! Watch out."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSaveMoonMission0950Lotus]
"Wait, the Security Eye just destroyed a Pendula. Try and trick it into taking out the rest."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSaveMoonMission0960Lotus]
"That's it, they eye is taking out the Pendula. Keep it up."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSaveMoonMission0980Lotus]
"Last one."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSaveMoonMission0990Lotus]
"It's done. The Moon is falling out of the Void. Hold on, this will not be a smooth ride. 

Get to extraction as quickly as possible."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSaveMoonOrbiter0680Ordis]
"The Moon. Somehow Ordis actually remembers the last time I was here. Concern for the Operator is at critical levels."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSaveMoonOrbiter0690AladV]
"The suspense is killing me! Lotus you have to tell us your secr- Hey, don't cut me off-"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSaveMoonOrbiter0700Lotus]
"Within The Moon, lies the Reservoir, the secret to your Tenno power. But this secret is dangerous, it drove the Stalker to madness. Forgive my deception, I was only trying to protect you from the same fate.

Now it is time to protect yourselves by ensuring The Moon remains within the safety of the Void."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSaveResMission1010Lotus]
"We saved The Moon from a Void collapse but Hunhow can now attack the Reservoir directly. He must not reach this sacred place."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSaveResMission1020Hunhow]
"Shadow, bleed the Reservoir until it is desert dry."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSaveResMission1030Hunhow]
"Lotus, join with me, destroy your shame. Become the one I love, become Natah once more."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSaveResOrbiter1000Lotus]
"The Moon is back in normal space but the Reservoir is in more danger than ever. Hunhow will send his fighters and the Stalker is still coming for you. Move now."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSentientDamage0070Lotus]
"Sentient fighters can adapt to your attacks. Hit them with something else."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSentientDamage0080Lotus]
"It has developed immunity to your attacks, try something different."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSentientDamage0090Lotus]
"The Sentient has adapted to your damage, surprise them with something new."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSentientMobDef0010Lotus]
"The Sentient mind has scrambled the systems. Eliminate all Sentients before I can continue."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSentientMobDef0020Lotus]
"The Sentients are causing too much interference, you have to deal with them before we can go on."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSentientMobDef0030Lotus]
"This isn't working, it's the Sentients, take them out."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSentientMobDefClear0010Lotus]
"Sentient forces eliminated we can continue."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSentientMobDefClear0020Lotus]
"That's it, they're all gone, we can resume our mission."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSentientScout0010Lotus]
"Oculysts! If they scan you, Sentient fighters won't be far behind. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSentientScout0020Lotus]
"Those Oculysts are scanning for targets"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSentientScout0030Lotus]
"Sentient scouts! If they detect you fighters will soon attack."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSentientSpawn0040Lotus]
"They know you're here. Prepare for Sentient fighters."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSentientSpawn0050Lotus]
"The Sentient has detected you. Fighters incoming."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSentientSpawn0060Lotus]
"The Sentient is on to you, look out for troopers."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostColony0200ErgoGlast]
"You fought with a generous spirit Tenno but now we must work to free the Myconians and return their Triuna. The Sequence offered to pay Anyo an exorbitant ransom, but he laughed it off. He doesn't need the money. So we have no choice but to exploit Anyo's weakness. His love of gambling. Our only chance of freeing these people is to challenge Anyo and his brokers in The Index."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostColony0210Lotus]
"Slow down Glast. My Tenno have already offered immense help and now you want them to enter The Index? This is dangerous work."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostColony0220ErgoGlast]
"Fair, but the Myconians aren't asking for charity. Their ancestral understanding of the Infestation comes from an Old War relic. A relic that I know, will be of extreme interest to you. Return their Triuna, and the relic will be yours. Fair compensation for the risk."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostColony0230ErgoGlast]
"To beat Mr. Anyo at his own game, we must first show him that we are worthy competitors. Only then will he let us enter the upper echelons of this foul Index."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostFive0740Lotus]
"Ergo's suspicions are correct, Nef cheated. I have identified the systems responsible for these cheats. I need you to break into Anyo Corp's servers and steal the control codes for his traps."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostFour0640Neewa]
"Papa said I was born special. "Neewa..." he said, "you're not just our child, you are the Triuna, our protector!" I guess no one asks to be the Triuna. It was just… my turn… but without me, the Mumblers will take all of our families. They'll be mushed together like smudged ink. Lost forever. I have to get out of here. I have to get home."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostFour0650Lotus]
"Neewa is the Triuna!? That's why Nef's so interested in her. Suddenly this all makes sense. The Myconians had concealed her abilities to protect her. But, why give a child such a burden?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostFour0660NefAnyo]
"My dear Glast, why are you so eager to tempt ruin for a little girl? You'll soon see how the Void favors my fortune above yours."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostFour0670ErgoGlast]
"Wealth has no purpose until turned against suffering. I'd wager more if I had it."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostMatchTwo0400Neewa]
"The dark-eyed man came today. He tapped the bars and said soon we'd be put to work. Fine! I screamed at him, "only if you tell us what's going on. Are my parents safe?" He just laughed at me and said something about the Void. I wonder what the Mumblers would do to his face?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostOne0340Lotus]
"Glast, why is Nef so interested in Neewa, what are you not telling us?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostOne0350ErgoGlast]
"I can only assume Anyo is trying to bait us back to the Index. Thankfully his gambling is a compulsion. We must win her back, for the Myconians."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostOne0360Lotus]
"Hmmm… I see."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostOne0370NefAnyo]
"I'm willing to bet one or two of these useless children if it means a chance to bankrupt your bleeding heart Perrin Sequence. All those executives will surely come crawling back to me. Fodder for the Index!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostRelay0050Lotus]
"Tenno, I trust Ergo Glast, but a colony that survives amid the Infestation? It seems impossible."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostSix1080ErgoGlast]
"Lotus, you may now return the child to her people."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostSix1090Lotus]
"She could be cured. Why return her? So she lives a shortened life, surrounded by monsters?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostSix1100ErgoGlast]
"Surrounded by family, her people, who honor her. Are you really going to impose your own values on these people you don't understand?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostSix1110Lotus]
"She only thinks this is what she wants. What you call tradition others call indoctrination. If she comes to the relay and is cured, she'll be free to return to her people if that's her choice."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostSix1120ErgoGlast]
"And the Myconians? Without the Passing, their way of life will end forever. Their skills, their traditions, wiped out by a powerful outsider."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostSix1130Lotus]
"They'd have to adapt, yes. We'd do our best to protect them, as we do for all that suffer."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostSix1140Lotus]
"Tenno, you've lived through similar obligations. What would you choose for Neewa?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostSix1150Neewa]
"This is a strange place, so clean. Everyone is nice to me, so I guess I'll get used to it. I'm still weak from the treatment but I feel stronger every day. I don't know what I'm going to do now. I guess anything I want. I miss my Papa and my family, but I sure don't miss the mumblers. Thank you, Tenno."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostSix1160Neewa]
"I know our ways might seem strange to outsiders but they're our ways. I would never choose to be anything but Myconian. To be their Triuna for as long as I can. Thank you, Tenno, for keeping my family safe when I couldn't."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostSix1170Neewa]
"I've returned to my people… but… I've decided I will be the last Triuna. I want a future where all of the children can be happy. A new tradition. Papa is so proud of me. "The last Triuna and greatest of all. The one that changed Myconians forever.""

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostSpyMission0830Neewa]
"How much longer can I go on for? The Passing will come in a few years with no one to take the Triuna from me. I'll just be gone, surrounded by rusting robots, and the Triuna will be lost forever."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostSpyMission0840Lotus]
"Ergo, what is this, "Passing"? What do you know about the Triuna?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostSpyMission0850ErgoGlast]
"Triuna is the Myconian's chosen one. It passes from one to the next in a simple ceremony. A pin prick on the finger is all it is."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostSpyMission0860Lotus]
"A disease?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostSpyMission0870ErgoGlast]
"Yes, likely. The Myconians may be carriers with ancestral resistance to the Infestation. Or they are merely keepers of the flame, perpetuating a weaker strain through this ritual."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostSpyMission0880Lotus]
"The Infested fear hybrids."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostSpyMission0890ErgoGlast]
"They do. And so the Myconians harvest them without violence. That is their way of life. Eventually, the Triuna succumbs to the burden and so they must pass it on. And on. Lighting a new torch before the other fades away."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostSpyMission0900Lotus]
"Fades? You mean dies. We could cure her before that happened!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostSpyMission0910ErgoGlast]
"Of what? An extraordinary gift? No Triuna would ever want to lose that. They live in honor, to serve their people, for the greater good."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostSpyMission0920Lotus]
"But they're only children."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostSpyMission0930NefAnyo]
"It's over Glast. I have everything I want. Neewa is mine, and the Sequence's President is in ruin! You have nothing to wager that interests me."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostSpyMission0940ErgoGlast]
"Hah, the Myconians do. An Old War relic will be our wager. In a way, a product of the Void, something you have more than Passing interesting for, am I right?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostSpyMission0950NefAnyo]
"Don't kid yourself… I… What? It's disgusting. It's… beautiful! Those colonists would wager this?! Don't those idiots realize how much this is worth?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostSpyMission0960ErgoGlast]
"All or nothing, held in escrow. Are you in, Nef?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DShipPostSpyMission0970NefAnyo]
"Hmmm… yes. By the Void, I'm in!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQCapObj0040Lotus]
"I have tracked Maroo to this Corpus outpost. Bring her to me for questioning. Be as persuasive as necessary, she may not want to come with us but it's in her best interest."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQCapObjReinf0050Lotus]
"The Arcane Codices have been a mystery ever since they were uncovered decades ago. They appear to be part of a set that was incomplete until the Grineer found this final code. Without the full set nobody can agree on what exactly they are."

"Maroo, I am the Lotus. I come as a friend. You are in mortal danger and you need to come with us."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQCapture0400Teshin]
"The Grineer have plunged these depths and awakened an old evil submerged here. Capture the Sergeant, he will know where this tomb is."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQCapture0410Lotus]
"Teshin! You don't have the authority. You are endangering the Tenno."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQCapture0420Teshin]
"So… the petals have opened once more. But why now? Afraid of what we'll find?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQCapture0430Lotus]
"I had to cover my tracks. But I see that Teshin has been leading you into an even greater danger."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQCapture0440Teshin]
"The beast soon stirs, Lotus, revealing much. It will awaken and become whole again."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQCapture0450Lotus]
"The SENTIENT."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQCapture0460Teshin]
"You know this one, don't you?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQCapture0470Teshin]
"He knows where the tomb is - apprehend him."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQCapture0480Teshin]
"We have our target. Advance to extraction."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQCapture0490Teshin]
"Speak, Lotus. The pieces are set. It is your move."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQCapture0500Lotus]
"Tyl Regor must be stopped from entering the tomb. I have to risk exposure to stop him. Go."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQDefense0790Lotus]
"A focused blast could release the magma flows beneath and rebury the tomb. Protect the bomb during its lengthy arming process."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQDefense0800Tyl]
"Destroy this tomb? Destroy our history? Vandals!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQDefense0810Teshin]
"Those who pilfer meat from lions are either foolish or starving, which are you Regor?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQDefense0820SentientVoice]
"Natah, why did you betray me? Why did you not finish the sequence you started? Why did you stop at the last?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQDefense0830Teshin]
" What is it talking about Lotus?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQDefense0840SentientVoice]
"We crossed the gap, wombs in ruin, to bring an end to this. We severed the worlds, let them destroy me, why is the sequence not complete?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQDefense0850Tyl]
"Most intriguing, Lotus, do you two have a history?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQDefense0860SentientVoice]
"My own daughter. The last of my womb. How can you do this?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQDefense0870Teshin]
"Lotus. What are you not telling us?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQDefense0880Lotus]
"Focus Teshin. We need focus."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQDefense0890Lotus]
"Hold on Tenno, it's almost armed."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQDefense0900SentientVoice]
"You betrayed us. As I awake, so will they. They will say you're riven and want to reclaim you. I will not be able to stop them."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQDefense0910SentientVoice]
"Finish the sequence and I will forgive you. Fail at this and you will be reclaimed by your own Father."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQDefense0940Lotus]
"There are gaps. I had my mission and I have completed it. All but the last sequence."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQDefense0950Teshin]
"To destroy the Tenno."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQDefense0960Lotus]
"The war was over. So I hid them away in the second dream. I could not destroy them."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQDefense0970Teshin]
"And yet you were born to. So tell me... What made you stop? To reject your nature?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQDefense0980Lotus]
"All missions to the Origin system required a sacrifice. Me and my kind become barren when crossing the gap. It is the one flaw that we never overcame."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQDefense0990Teshin]
"Natah wanted children of her own."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQDefense1000Lotus]

"Oh, so you tin-suits want to know about that Arcane Codex? Heh, is that all?; 
Okay here goes. Tyl Regor offered up big time credits for me to pull the code from some strange machine on an Infested Orokin Derelict.;
Thing is, I never much liked the Grineer, so the code I pulled ain't the code I gave em. Heh, I guess they've finally figured that out?;
I bet you're looking to get your hands on the code? Too bad, I already sold em to the Corpus… Now, if you were to make it worth my while? Maybe I'd tell you where they're keeping it…"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQInterlude0330Ordis]
"Operator, I've been looking into these Arcane Codices. Did you know the Corpus are in possession of three codices and the Grineer two? "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQInterlude0340Lotus]
"And now the Tenno have one too. Nobody has ever examined them all together, that's our plan."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQInterlude0350Ordis]
"The Corpus seem think they'll lead to some lost Orokin treasure."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQInterlude0360Maroo]
"Ordo, did you say treasure?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQInterlude0370Ordis]
" It's Ordis, and while just a theory, it is plausible."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQInterlude0380Maroo]
"Either way, it's right up my alley. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQInterlude0460Ordis]
"Operator, have you looked at these codices? They're absolutely beautiful. Composed with such elegance and grace, I have never seen anything like them. Is there even an Operator capable of writing anything so perfect? "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQInterlude0470Maroo]
"But you still have no idea what they mean, do you?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQInterlude0480Ordis]
"No, not really, pfft… well, I wouldn't expect the likes of you to understand."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQInterlude0520Ordis]
"Operator, these make sense now! This is machine code, meant to interface directly with a machine. Pity that machine has likely rusted into dust by now."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQInterlude0530Maroo]
" ORDO? Did you say something about a machine?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQInterlude0540Ordis]
"Ordis' name is Ordis."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQInterlude0550Maroo]
"Yah, yah. Listen, that first codex in the derelict, I pulled it from some sort of machine. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQInterlude0560Ordis]
"Hmmm, I wonder, if we load the complete set of Arcane Codices back into that machine, would the code still execute?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQInterlude0570Lotus]
"We're about to find out. Tenno, get ready to go into the void."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQInterlude0700Ordis]
"So you're saying there was no treasure, no cure for cloning syndrome, no lost Tenno Cephalon?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQInterlude0710Maroo]
"Ordo, there was nothing."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQInterlude0720Ordis]
"That really is a shame Maroo, I am sorry."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQInterlude0730Maroo]
"Nah, I'm used to it. When you don't run with any the major factions or syndicates, the big pay days are few and far between. I'll manage."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQInterlude0740Maroo]
"Listen, I can't say it hasn't been fun, but with the Arcane Codices gone, I think it's safe for me to venture back out into the wild. Cya Tin-Suits."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQIntro0010Lotus]
"This is unexpected. After decades of searching, the Grineer finally uncovered the last of the Arcane Codices only to lose it to some thief. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQIntro0020Lotus]
"Tyl Regor must be livid, which means this Maroo is real trouble. I need to have a word with her before the Grineer do."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQIntro0030Ordis]
"Arcane Codices, why have I never heard of them? Ordis needs to do some research."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQMobileDefense0180Teshin]
"The ghost you saw is of a menace long thought dead. They study us, study our enemies. Let us sharpen our knowledge of them."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQMobileDefense0190Teshin]

"This Grineer is smarter than the others. More volatile. We need to be cautious."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQMobileDefense0390Teshin]
"Find his Sergeant, pupil. He will lead us to this 'tomb'."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQPostQuest1010Tyl]

So, you know where I am, come get me… just try."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQPostQuest1020Lotus]
"Tenno, you know where Tyl is. When you are ready, destroy him."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQPreQuest0010Lotus]
"Tenno? What did you see? My data stream went dark."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQPreQuest0020Lotus]
"I am sensing some signal masking. It will take some time to decypher. Concentrate on your mission for now."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQPreQuest0040Lotus]
"I have just detected signatures matching the new drone. Gather scans of it to determine its origin and capabilities."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQRaidExtraction0670Lotus]
"Tenno, I don't know if we got the answers we come for, but there's nothing more here for us. Exit the Derelict and head for extraction."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQRaidExtraction0680Maroo]
" What? Where's my damn treasure. I was told there would be treasure."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQRaidExtraction0690Lotus]
"Whatever that was, it wasn't here for our benefit or yours. Only time will tell what we've just uncovered."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQRaidMachine0630Maroo]
"There it is, the machine I pulled the final Arcane Codex from. You've got the full set of codices, upload 'em and say hello to treasure."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQRaidMachine0640SentientVoice]
"All is silent and calm. Hushed and empty is the womb of the sky."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQRaidMachine0650Maroo]
"What just happened?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQRaidMachine0660Lotus]
"The machine, it's gone. Tenno watch out."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQRaidMissionObj0580Lotus]
"Tenno, Maroo is the only person who has been on the inside of that derelict and lived to tell about it. She'll guide you through this mission."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQRaidMissionObj0590Maroo]
"This is it. Your Lotus has promised me a cut of whatever treasure you find, so don't you tin-suits go messing this one up. Get to the void portal."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQRaidMissionObj0600Lotus]
"Maroo, I said 'if' there is any treasure. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQRaidMissionObj0610Maroo]
"The Orokin were all about treasure, weren't they. The only question is, how much?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQRaidPortal0620Maroo]
"The Grineer have been trying to get inside this derelict for days but The Infested keep tearing them to shreds. Your Lotus seems to think you'll do better… we'll see."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQScanMission0050Lotus]
"I've marked the signatures on your map. Gather scans but approach with caution, Tenno."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQScanMission0060Lotus]
"It doesn't seem very interested in you. Try to get a scan of what it's collecting, it may reveal its purpose."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQScanMission0070Lotus]
"I'm not getting a good feed. Is there an object they're pulling data from? Scan it for me."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQScanMission0080Lotus]
"It's… it's just Old War wreckage. Why are the Corpus suddenly interested in it?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQScanMission0090Lotus]
" Tenno, another scannable signature just appeared near you. We may be able to determine what the Corpus are up to."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQScanMission0100Lotus]
"I'm not getting a signal but if you've found a drone, scan it before it notices you."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQScanMission0120Lotus]
"This thing is not a Corpus design. If you can get another scan, I can determine its origin."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQScanMission0130Lotus]
"Tenno, I need you to scan another drone."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQScanMission0140Lotus]
"Good! I'm putting the stream together now - it's … it's an Oculyst? That means… I'm sorry, Tenno, stay safe- "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQScanMission0150Ordis]
"Hello? Did the Lotus just abandon the Operator get cut off? I have extraction ready. I think you should hurry."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQScanMission0160Ordis]
"Operator. Ordis knows what it is like to be abandoned. Don't worry, someone has offered to help us!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQScanMission0170Teshin]
"So, pupil, the spring has ended. The Lotus blossom has snapped shut, her true nature revealed. Now we shall see if codependence can be broken. Let us begin to unravel her long-hidden truth."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSpyAlarmTrigger0210Maroo]
"Smooth one tin-suit. Now, hurry up and get the data before it's destroyed."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSpyAlarmTrigger0220Maroo]
"There's the alarms. Get moving!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSpyAlarmTrigger0230Maroo]
"Now you've gone and done it. Get to that console, quick!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSpyDataLost0290Maroo]
"Too slow. Good thing there's another vault. Try not to mess things up next time."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSpyExtraction0320Maroo]
"You've explored all the vaults and found that Arcane Codex. Your Lotus told me to tell you to get to extraction."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSpyExtraction0430Lotus]
"You've got the codices and there is nothing more for us here. Get to extraction."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSpyFailure0310Maroo]
"You managed to fail every vault. Maybe you're just not cut out for this type of work, tin-suit."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSpyFailure0440Lotus]
"You have failed too many data vaults, the Codex has been destroyed. This mission is over."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSpyLastAlarm0300Maroo]
"Again, really? You know we're here to take the data, right? You've got one more chance."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSpyNearVault0200Maroo]
"The data vault is nearby. Do your best and try not to trip the alarms. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSpyObj0150Maroo]
"Listen up ya tin-suits, with the Grineer itching to torture the life out of me, I've accepted your Lotus's offer of protection. In return, I'm gonna help your sorry behinds find that Arcane Codex."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSpyObj0390Lotus]
"Maroo tells me that the Grineer are storing their two Arcane Codices on this Galleon. You need to find both to complete this mission."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSpyObj0490Lotus]
"We've tracked down the remaining Arcane Codices to this Corpus facility."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSpyObjReinf0160Lotus]
"My Tenno are quite capable, Maroo. Perhaps you would prefer it if we dropped you off outside the nearest Grineer mining asteroid?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSpyObjReinf0170Maroo]
"Wow, she always this much fun?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSpyObjReinf0180Lotus]
" Maroo?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSpyObjReinf0190Maroo]
"Fine... here's the business. The Corpus are keeping the Codex in one of these fortified data vaults, you gotta break in and take what's yours without triggering the data destruction sequence."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSpyObjReinf0400Maroo]
"The Grineer claim the Arcane Codices will help them to a cure for cloning decay syndrome. I think that might be wishful thinking. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSpyObjReinf0500Lotus]
"There are three data vaults and three Codices. Proceed with caution, if Corpus security destroy even one of these fragments this mission will be a failure."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSpyObjReinf0510Lotus]
"We have all the three codices, you may extract now."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSpyRetrievalAlarm0240Maroo]
"Nice recovery. Had me worried for a second there."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSpyRetrievalAlarm0250Maroo]
"Well, it weren't pretty but you got what we were looking for."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSpyRetrievalNoAlarm0260Maroo]
"Surprisingly impressive, you found the codex and the Corpus are none the wiser."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSpyRetrievalNoAlarm0270Maroo]
"There's the codex. There might be hope for you after all."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSpyRetrievalNoAlarm0410Lotus]
"Good work. You found an Arcane Codex."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSpyRetrievalNoAlarm0420Lotus]
"That's it. That's the Arcane Codex."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSpyVaultsRemain0280Maroo]
"You got that Codex. Why don't you see if the Corpus are hiding anything else in the other vaults."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSurvival0510Lotus]
"Get to the waypoint, I will give you further instructions when you get there."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSurvival0520Lotus]
"You've reached the waypoint. Access this system."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSurvival0530Tyl]
"Knew it!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSurvival0540Tyl]
"Little lizards can't resist another chance to get their sticky hands in my jar."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSurvival0550Lotus]
"Tyl's cut off life support. Hold on Tenno. I am readying extraction but this will take time."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSurvival0560Tyl]
"The Sentient… the destroyer? The liberator? Depends on who you ask… But this, this thing is certain: I will have its secrets."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSurvival0570Teshin]
"Pupil, maintain your balance. The enemy is zealous for your death, let them find only their own."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSurvival0580Tyl]
"Funny, isn'it Tenno? I'm cracking open the Sentient's tomb and sealing yours at the same time. Not laughing? I dunno, I find it funny. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSurvival0590Teshin]
"It's not a tomb Regor… it's a cage. If you open it-"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSurvival0600Tyl]
"Is that Teshin? So the pseudo-Tenno lives… still drunk on your own honor? Shocked it hasn't rotted you through yet."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSurvival0610Tyl]
"So… the Sentient… nasty thing. Came from where? Who cares. They smashed the Orokin… freed us! How, how'd they do that? I want to know."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSurvival0620Tyl]
"Drilling… hundreds of hours and just cracking through the sarcophagus now. Open wide. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSurvival0630Tyl]
"Entering, it's massive, empty. But where are they? Did they escape? Wait… what's this… "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSurvival0640Teshin]
"Don't do it Regor… "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSurvival0650Tyl]
"Look! Exilus, some primordial Forma? An engine for self-manipulation, what will it do for me?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSurvival0660Lotus]
" What has he found?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSurvival0670SentientVoice]
"..."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSurvival0680Tyl]
" What was that…"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSurvival0690SentientVoice]
"..."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSurvival0700Tyl]
"Not alone… who's there?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSurvival0710SentientVoice]
"Natah… where are you? You cannot hide from me."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSurvival0720Tyl]
" All of you, retreat, now."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSurvival0730SentientVoice]
"Natah who have you become? Does this form remind you of what you once were? Time has carried my seed so very far from the branch."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSurvival0740Lotus]
" Extraction ready. Leave now. Get out."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSurvival0750Teshin]
"Pupil, what is your Lotus hiding? Who is Natah?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSurvival0760Lotus]
"My name, my old name. It is not who I am now. We need to focus on now, not history. We need to seal the tomb. A blast capable-"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSurvival0770Teshin]
"The Sentient is awake, Natah. It will not be contained for long."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSurvival0780Lotus]
"Do not call me that. Containment will buy us time. Go now, Tenno, I will explain more when you reach the site."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DSQSurvival0790SentientVoice]
"..."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel1Challenge00010Baro]
"I could have never foreseen this, that Vessel, it contains primitive etchings that seem to be a sort of blueprint. Was a Warframe entombed there?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel1Challenge00020Baro]
"Look at it. It's exquisite. There's an inscription: "Prove you are him, destroy the ones who oppress." Destroy who? Does this smudged glyph represent some enemy? You will have to carry that Vessel into battle and prove yourself if we are to unlock these secrets."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel1Challenge00030Baro]
"If you want to prove yourself, you're going to need to carry that Burial Vessel in your inventory."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel1Challenge00040Baro]
"Whatever that Vessel wants you to do, I'm certain it's somehow connected to that smudged glyph."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel1Challenge00050Baro]
"I don't know how this happened, but the glyph on that Sacred Vessel, it's changed. I suggest you stay on this path."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel1Challenge00060Baro]
"The glyph, it's changed. You must be fulfilling some primitive rite of passage…"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel1Challenge00070Baro]
"The vessel, it's responding to your actions."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel1Challenge00080Baro]
"Tenno, look, the glyph. It's completely clear. And there's a new inscription: "Return for him." Return to the tomb so we can get past this superstitious nonsense and on to something worthwhile."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel1Phobos00010Baro]
"You can feel the filth and the grit in every breath. This desolate rock is the former colony of backward-thinking sky worshippers. Their stories are worth as much as the sand around you. Nothing."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel1Phobos00020Baro]
"The Grineer took 'pity' on their miserable existence years ago, returning this so-called civilization to the sand. Yet, for some elusive reason, their relics have become quite fashionable and thus valuable. Rare antiquities, that's why we're here."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel1Phobos00030Baro]
"Ignore these glyphs, nothing but nonsense about their so-called god-king. Inaros, is it? How quaint - the only thing heaven-sent from Inaros will be the price his relics fetch at auction."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel1Phobos00040Baro]
"A Burial Vessel! It will contain precious relics… There there - you're not defiling a tomb, you're creating wealth!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel1Phobos00050Mother]
"Hush my little dune. You don't need to be scared. There, there, that's right, shake out the sand, but remember, not all of it... and I'll tell you the story."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel1Phobos00060Baro]
"Tenno - what is this? How are you doing that?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel1Phobos00070Mother]
"Long ago, the lands of our colony were cursed, soaked in fear. The Golden Skymen would come and take our children away… Young and old alike, cowered before them, afraid to lose their most beloved."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel1Phobos00080Baro]
"That voice… Tenno, stop this."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel1Phobos00090Mother]
"But then he came. The Fear-eater. The skykiller. He was called… Inaros!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel1Phobos00100Baro]
"Return to your ship, we must examine this vessel further."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel2Challenge00010Baro]
"I'm beginning to think this Inaros myth was drawn from… an actual Warframe?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel2Challenge00020Baro]
"Oh I see. Another glyph? Another challenge. See if you can figure out which enemy it represents."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel2Challenge00030Baro]
"This wretched place, why did I even come here? I keep telling myself it was the treasure but… Push it back, stupid Baro, there's no wealth in these memories. Tenno, we need to open that next chamber. Go."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel2Phobos00010Baro]
"I'll be grateful when this is over, I cannot stand this barren place. Even the Orokin could not enlighten those sand skates."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel2Phobos00020Baro]
"Remember, we're here for relics, not stories, so I'd appreciate if you kept your Tenno soma-void-resonance… 'thing' to a minimum. I've had enough of this culture to last a lifetime."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel2Phobos00030Baro]
"Take the Vessel to the door. What happens?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel2Phobos00040Mother]
"Little one, after this you must sleep…"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel2Phobos00050Baro]
"Not again..."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel2Phobos00060Mother]
"Inaros began not as our King, but as our enemy, a warrior of the Golden Skymen. But for each child the Skymen took away, Inaros grew ever more angry - until one fateful night."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel2Phobos00070Mother]
"Another child had been taken and the villagers had gathered in a mourning circle, weeping... until they heard a small voice. By the dunes! It was the child, returned! As he approached the people gasped in horror as they saw that he was drenched in blood."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel2Phobos00080Mother]
"His father rushed to the boy and embraced him - and saw that he had no wounds. Whose blood is this, he asked? The boy looked to the sky and said - this is the Blood of the Skymen. This is the work of Inaros."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel2Phobos00090Mother]
"By the sand and stars, the Skymen raged. They set upon Inaros with their armies but none could prevail... for he commanded the sand, he commanded death. Inaros ate their fear and became stronger."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel2Phobos00100Baro]
"None of this… none of this could be true. Could it?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel2Phobos00110Mother]
"And so they left us, and took with them our fear. On that day, Inaros became our King and, in a great whirlwind of sand, ascended to watch over us from his throne in the sky."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel2Phobos00120Baro]
"What if? It… It can't be."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel2Phobos00140Baro]
"That voice, return to your ship. I… I must collect myself."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel3Challenge00180Baro]

"And so for years we lived in peace and our little dunes were our own to keep. But the sands of peace are ever-shifting. Years later a plague came to the desert. The Infested."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel3Phobos00040Mother]
"Desperate, our people called out to sky: Inaros! Inaros! But they could not wake him… and so they were consumed by the ravenous horde. With all lost, the few remaining villagers gathered in the mourning circle to prepare for the end... when suddenly, a storm rose about them… A colossal spiral storm of sand, piercing the sky! The villagers huddled, trapped within the storm's eye as the beasts charged them... In moments the beasts were torn apart and the Infested plague was swept away, never to be seen again. As the storm subsided the people ventured out into the desert, hoping to catch a glimpse of their saviour, their beloved Inaros..."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel3Phobos00050Baro]
"Get ready!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel3Phobos00060Mother]
"They found his glorious metal body, broken and still, lying in the sand. Did they mourn? No. They knew his spirit had returned to the sky to watch over them, once again. They gathered his body to keep it safe from thieves and raiders. They placed the pieces within sacred vessels and entombed them in secret… knowing that one day Inaros would reclaim his body and rise again."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Quests/DVessel3Phobos00070Mother]
"So now my sweet dune, you have no need of fear. Take these grains, and keep them under your pillow. Inaros will watch over you."

"It wasn't me I was worried about."

"But Inaros never came."

"What a pleasant surprise. Perhaps there's hope for you after all."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Relays/DPurchPoor0380Baro]
"I underestimated you Tenno. I do hope you didn't put yourself in a hole for this?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Relays/DSellGroupAllFull300Maroo]
"Oh me, oh my, would you look at these? You can almost smell the Endo. Nice work."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Relays/DSellGroupEmpty340Maroo]
"You know Tenno, you'll get more Endo if you use your Mod Bench to insert Ayatan Stars into the Sculptures. "

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Relays/DSellGroupEmpty350Maroo]
"Anyone ever tell you that the Ayatan Stars and Sculptures can be put together using your Mod Bench? You just wait and see what happens when you fill one completely."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Relays/DSellGroupPartialFull310Maroo]
"Lotta good stuff here, Tenno. But you could score even more Endo with complete sculptures."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Relays/DSellGroupPartialFull320Maroo]
"Interesting collection. Looks like you brought me a little bit of everything. Of course, I don't have to tell you how valuable these sculptures would be if they were all complete."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Relays/DSellGroupPartialFull330Maroo]
"Maybe next time you'll bring me complete sculptures? I always get way more Endo out of complete sculptures."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Relays/DStarsOnly130Maroo]
"That's a fine Ayatan Star, but it'd be worth more Endo if you used your Mod Bench to put it in a sculpture."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/Relays/DStarsOnly140Maroo]

"My bags are packed, I'm all set to leave. I can't believe I'll be working with one of my childhood heroes, Archimedian Margulis! On comms she said she needed the best Infestation biologist there was… I think my knees almost gave out!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/SilverGrove/DCodexA00020Silvana]
"As I log this, I'm looking out the stained plastic of my field tent into the dead-yellow sky of Earth. I smell the vague sulphur and toxins leaking through the seals, yet somehow I'm going to miss this place. Leaving her feels like I'm giving up on my dream. My dream to see green and blue return to this sick and dying mother of us all."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/SilverGrove/DCodexA00030Silvana]
"But I'm frustrated with my lack of progress. I've tried everything to accelerate the ailing vegetation, to guide and nurture the soil, but nothing comes of it. I need a change. Now I have that opportunity… and thanks to Margulis, I'm relieved I won't be drafted into some Orokin War Project."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/SilverGrove/DCodexB00010Silvana]
"My childhood dream has become a nightmare. I don't blame Margulis, she's as much a victim as the children we're working with. At first, the project seemed therapeutic and nurturing. I was myself. But now… Transference therapy is being turned into a weapon. Now I build these vile weapons called "Warframes" all for one purpose: death. I've become everything I hate."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/SilverGrove/DCodexB00020Silvana]

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/SilverGrove/DCodexB00030Silvana]
"Titania is the next Warframe I've been commanded to build, but in secret I've been siphoning resources from the project. I have an idea. A way back to that wounded land I call home. A way for me to forget this war and remember what I was."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/SilverGrove/DCodexC00010Silvana]
"Ballas is beyond pleased… but when I look at what I've built… at Titania, I feel sick creep up my throat. I hate her, a killer made by a healer. No more. I'm going back to where I belong, no matter the cost. I'm going back to the trees to find myself again."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/SilverGrove/DCodexC00020Silvana]
"These past weeks, I've been secretly testing Transference on myself. I can only survive short bursts - linking to Titania the way only Tenno can stand. I've never felt anything like it. A tortured presence, like an evil ink, staining my mind. But… it worked. I'm going to use this wrong to make right."

"I'll stowaway with Earth-bound cargo. Just my Apothics and these slapdash Somatics I've stolen. By nightfall I'll be home again in a my tent under those bitter, acid skies. This time I'm going to fix it. I will seed a mighty forest, stronger than history… and by my will, use it to bring life."

"Do you know of the Silver Grove, Earth's oldest and most pure forest? It is home to our most sacred shrine. We've learned that the Grineer, those twisted abominations, are planning to build a factory on it. Grineer Scorch units have been deployed, intent on turning our blessed Silver Grove to ash. Generations ago we recovered an Apothic recipe at the Shrine… we believe it will reawaken the forest's legendary defenses. Gather the ingredients and deliver the Apothic to the heart of the shrine. You are the only hope for the Silver Grove and the natural purity it represents."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/SilverGrove/DShipB00030Ordis]

"The Silver Grove was planted with the rotted seeds of the Orokin, corrupt in the eyes of our doctrine. Our tenets command us to reject it, but how can we? Silvana longed to restore Earth's former glory, just as we do. 
 
 If we are to see Earth restored, perhaps New Loka itself must change? I will convince them to see Silvana's creation for the miracle it is. Some will call that heresy, but it is true, and truth is the purest thing we have."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/SilverGrove/DShrineA00010Amaryn]
"Ahhhhh, the Silver Grove. Can you feel the purity? Beyond, all is contaminated, toxic. But here, everything is pure, original. That's why your mission is so important. Can we risk losing this?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/SilverGrove/DShrineA00030Amaryn]

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/SilverGrove/DShrineA00060Amaryn]
"Did you hear that? Unbelievable, the Grove, it speaks! My heart… Wait… a new Apothic! We will learn its recipe, forage its ingredients. The Grove needs this. New Loka needs this. It's time to… Wait-"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/SilverGrove/DShrineA00090Amaryn]

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/SilverGrove/DShrineB00010Amaryn]
"You're just in time. They're choking the forest with their flames. You must reach the Shrine before they do. Oh, Tenno, why do they hate everything not born of their disgusting flesh factories?"

"Forgive me, Silvana, I doubted you. I thought you were just another Orokin poison."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/SilverGrove/DShrineC00170Silvana]
"I once thought the same of Warframes. When the Orokin found out what I had done here, they sent their Dax upon the great trees. Upon me. As the skies grew hot and my roots split into cinder, I let out a deep earthen-scream. I was dying. And then suddenly I felt a familiar presence…"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/SilverGrove/DShrineC00180Silvana]
"One by one, the mighty Dax began to fall, swatting hopelessly at some unseen menace. Others were snared, drifting upward in a mesmerizing light and then, all at once, shredded by that unseen force. When the fires subsided, I knew what it was."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/SilverGrove/DShrineC00190Silvana]
"Titania. My shamed creation. I felt her beating wings through my branches. I felt her mortal wounds, her weeping burns as she fell beneath my canopy. And so it was here, within this grove, that she died to save me. Me, the one who had hated her most."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/SilverGrove/DShrineC00200Amaryn]

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DCave0050Teshin]
"As I thought. The hard way, then."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DCave0060OperatorVoiceA]
"So the great Teshin is just a dog… fetching the Queen's stick wherever she throws it."

"I warned you. Now you're trapped inside this place with the Queens burrowing in. Now I am forced to undo what Margulis did, to open the gates… and make you suffer."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DCave0071Teshin]
"Know this Tenno, that I am a Dax. A soldier of a lost era, the last of my kind. By Orokin hands we Dax were given great power, great strength… but an even greater weakness."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DCave0072Teshin]
"To obey their command. To never defy the Kuva, the Scepter, the symbols of their dominion. No Dax can ever raise steel against an Orokin. Only you can do that."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DCave0080Teshin]
"Margulis lied to you, a lie of omission. She did not cure the Zariman children - she erased them. My only hope is that truth still lingers inside you, buried within your mind. The power and the misery… of the Void."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DCave0090Teshin]
"The Ayatan Sculptures are perpetually in motion, monuments of Orokin Continuity... immortality. But this one is halted and aging, needing you, as the Queens do. Will you give in to them? Or will you face the coil?"

"What is that thing?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSApproachSiphon0040Lotus]
"Those are Queens' braids. What are they up to?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSBraidDestroyed0410WormQueen]
"The child's hurting my Kuva Siphon! Queen's Immortal Guard… pfft… you're just a waste of food."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSBraidDestroyed0420WormQueen]
"No! Listen, if you let the Kuva Siphon get damaged again, I'll grind the lot of you into miniature-dumplings."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSBraidDestroyed0430WormQueen]
"My little rumple-dimples, why must you let them hurt my Siphon? Do you want me to get mean?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSBraidDestroyed0431WormQueen]
"I give you maggots the honor of eating from my scrap-trough and this is how you repay me? Unacceptable."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSBraidDestroyed0440WormQueen]
"Another failure! If you don't want to serve your Queen, you can always be served to her, on a platter."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSBraidDestroyed0450WormQueen]
"What are you overfed-swine doing? Protect the Siphon!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSBraidDestroyed0460WormQueen]
"What was I thinking?!? I never should have put my food in charge of something this important."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSBraidDestroyed0470WormQueen]
"You're not guards. You're compost heaps with legs. Useless."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSBraidDestroyed0480WormQueen]
"My Kuva! Do not let them do that again."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSBraidDestroyed0490WormQueen]
"No."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSBraidDestroyed0500WormQueen]
"Arrg!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSBraidDestroyed0510WormQueen]

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSDashThrough0290WormQueen]

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSDashThrough0300WormQueen]
"No. Protect the Siphon."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSDashThrough0310WormQueen]
"What a waste."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSDestroyAttempt0110Lotus]
"Your weapons aren't working. Try something else."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSDestroyAttempt0120Lotus]

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSDestroyAttempt0130WormQueen]
"You're snoring, dreamer. My machines are tougher than that."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSDestroyAttempt0140WormQueen]
"Boom, boom, BOOM! Look at those fireworks. But it's all for show, my Kuva Siphon is Warframe-proof."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSDestroyAttempt0150WormQueen]
"Distract the puppet. Make it dance and flail."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSDestroyOrder0090Lotus]

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSDestroyOrder0100Lotus]

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSEnergyAlmostComp0190WormQueen]
"The chamber is almost full. How exciting."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSEnergyAlmostComp0200WormQueen]
"Yes."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSEnergyAlmostComp0210WormQueen]
"More, I want more!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSEnergyAlmostComp0220WormQueen]
"Can you hear me sister? It won't be long now."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSEnergyGathered0160WormQueen]
"Double, double toil and trouble, the puppets dance while chamber bubbles."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSEnergyGathered0170WormQueen]
"What lovely energy. Every particle counts when we're making Kuva."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSEnergyGathered0180WormQueen]
"Listen to the chamber simmer. The longer that dreamer thrashes about the more Kuva essence we collect."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSSiphonDestroyed0540WormQueen]
"My siphon! I can't believe how useless you all are. Report for execution at once."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSSiphonDestroyed0550WormQueen]
"You useless balls of festering flesh. You let them destroy my Kuva Siphon."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSSiphonDestroyed0560WormQueen]
"My Siphon! My Kuva! You're messing up all my plans. I don't like it. Not one bit."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSSiphonDestroyed0570Lotus]
"Good work, Tenno. We need to do everything we can to stop the Queens from gathering anymore Kuva."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSSiphonDestroyed0580Lotus]
"You've destroyed the Queen's Kuva Siphon, we can't allow any of these to survive."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSSiphonFull0590WormQueen]
"Sweet Kuva. Sister, it won't be long before I see your beautifully grotesque face again."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSSiphonFull0600WormQueen]
"Groompas, you've served me well. I shall enjoy a feast in your honor."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSSiphonFull0610WormQueen]
"And done, another batch of Kuva particles for my Sister. Every bit counts you know."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSSiphonFull0620WormQueen]
"And with that I say goodbye."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSSiphonFull0630WormQueen]
"Siphoning complete. Guards, show the Tenno how much we appreciate their help."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSSiphonFull0640Lotus]
"You let them fill the Siphon! Tenno, we cannot allow the Queens to get enough Kuva to regain their power."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSSiphonFull0650Lotus]
"Tenno, that can't happen again. The next time you see one of those things, destroy it."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSSiphonFull0660Lotus]
"The Siphon is full. I cannot understate how much of a setback this is."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSSwitchOperator0230WormQueen]
"Wait, what is it doing?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSSwitchOperator0240WormQueen]
"Ick! I don't like it when the meatbag squirms out of its shell like that. Put it back."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSSwitchOperator0250Lotus]

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSSwitchOperator0270WormQueen]

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSSwitchOperator0280WormQueen]
"Ugh. Look at that scrawny creature, where's the meat?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSWormAnnounce0050WormQueen]
"Look at this, a Dreamer's sleep-stumbling onto my Kuva Siphon?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSWormAnnounce0060WormQueen]
"Listen. The machines are coming to life. There's kuva in the air!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSWormAnnounce0070WormQueen]
"Guardians, distract the child."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DKSWormAnnounce0080WormQueen]
"Relax child, you won't feel a thing. Promise."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DMirror0010Teshin]
"A Yuvan theater, long abandoned. In ages past, I would have stood guard as the young and exotic were paraded through the mountain pass and marched by the viewing pane. They'd barter here, the Orokin. Withering and coughing- as they prepared for their Continuity."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DMirror0090Ordis]
"Operator, are you... well? That surge burnt out the Transference circuits. I will have to begin repairs immediately."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DMirror0092Ordis]
"Operator? Is that… is that 'you'? Your brain activity flat-lined for a moment there… Can you speak? By stars, the Operator's mind is destroyed?!!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DMirror0093Ordis]

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DMirror0130Ordis]
"Careful Operator, you'll damage the ship… damage me!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DMirror0140Ordis]
"Amazing. How are you doing this? It is slightly terrifying if I'm honest."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DMirror0150Ordis]
"Operator, my sensors have gone dark. Where are you?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DMirror0160Ordis]
"Oh. There you are! Impressive. Very useful. Ordis is a little afraid right now."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DMirror0170Ordis]
"Operator, you'll breach the hull! Please restrain yourself."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DMirror0171Ordis]
"Have you lost your mind?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DMirror0180OperatorVoiceA]
"No. But I've lost my Warframe… and Teshin… what if the Queens know that he helped me escape? I have to go back."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DMirror0190Ordis]
"Impossible! Just as you thought, the base has moved again. We don't know where it is. There's no way back."

"Hmm... Some believe the Kuva within is the blood of Orokin Ancestors. An elixir of power… of immortality."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DMountainPeak0130Teshin]
"Others believe it to be a poison, a corrupting oil that brings madness and evil."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DMountainPeak0140OperatorVoiceA]

"What do you believe?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DMountainPeak0150Teshin]

"Hush, worm. Let the beasts do their work."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLair0230WormQueen]
"But the dreamers have awakened. They will come for us."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLair0240ElderQueen]

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairB0090Teshin]
"The child? For what purpose?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairB0100WormQueen]
"To eat it, of course!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairB0110ElderQueen]

"How rude!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairB0140ElderQueen]

"Ordis! What is this?!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairB0160Ordis]
"A Transference surge, Operator! You're losing your Warframe connection!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairB0170ElderQueen]
"You have some idea that you're invincible, don't you? Nestled away in that mad Cephalon's crib-"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairB0180ElderQueen]
"But you belong to me now. For you see, child, we conceived of these ugly, metal cysts."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairB0190Ordis]
"Operator! Cut the link!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairB0191Ordis]
"CUT THE LINK! Transference overload in 5...4...3..."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairB0200OperatorVoiceA]

"And now, just as easily, we take them all away!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0010ElderQueen]
"What did you do, Dax? What did you do?! How did a child reject the Continuity?"

"I came back for you."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0070ElderQueen]
"Stupid child. You don't give up, do you? But coming here in the flesh? That was a big mistake. Guards! Kill this Warframe and bring me my new skin!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0080Teshin]
"The red braids shield her. Destroy them!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0090ElderQueen]
"Shut up you insolent Dax!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0100Teshin]
"Without her Sceptre, she is powerless. Break her shields and use your dash to steal it."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0110ElderQueen]
"You'll pay for that."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0120ElderQueen]
"Long enough have I lived in these ugly Grineer bodies. I need new flesh… I deserve new flesh! Yours!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0130ElderQueen]
"By my Orokin blood, I command you, Teshin Dax, to kill this Tenno."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0140Teshin]
"No, I cannot."

"You must. By your oath eternal."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0160Teshin]

"Come out, come out, little demon."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0195ElderQueen]
"I see now, how you cast me out. Simple, really. There's no room for me in that wicked, swarming head of yours."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0200ElderQueen]
"Is this how you hunted the Zariman crew? Is this how you murdered your parents?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0210ElderQueen]
"Show yourself you little coward."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0230ElderQueen]
"What are you waiting for, Dax?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0241Teshin]
"A chance to kill you… and now I finally have it."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0242Teshin]
"Shall I, Tenno?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0250OperatorVoiceA]
"Kill her."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0250OperatorVoiceB]
"Kill her."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0250OperatorVoiceC]
"Kill her."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0250OperatorVoiceD]
"Kill her."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0260OperatorVoiceA]
"No. I will do it."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0260OperatorVoiceB]
"No. I will do it."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0260OperatorVoiceC]

"Guards! Kill this Warframe and bring me my new skin!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0282ElderQueen]
"Guards! Kill this Tenno!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0290Teshin]
"The Worm has rallied the troops. Get to your ship. I'll divert them. Go!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0310Lotus]
"Tenno? Tenno? I've been trying to get through. Are you... alright? Your Transference stream seems different, stronger."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0320OperatorVoiceA]
"We have neutralized the Queens. Teshin… Teshin helped me. I'm heading to extraction now."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0330Lotus]
"The Queens… they cut me off… I should have been there for you. I'll signal Ordis to pick you up right away."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0335Lotus]
"The Grineer are holding a parade in your honor. Watch for reinforcements ahead."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0340OperatorVoiceA]

"Understood."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0350Ordis]
"Thank the stars you're safe Operator! I forbid you to leave the Orbiter like that again, it's just too much for an old Cephalon like me."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0351Ordis]
"You rescued your Warframe! What a relief. But… Ordis wonders, are you still able to walk the ship as… yourself?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0352Ordis]
"Impressive! Just think of the possibilities! You can help me clean up that Infested door!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0360Lotus]
"A mother wants to shield her child from the evils of the world. Margulis didn't lie to you. She protected you."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0370OperatorVoiceA]
"But isn't it better I know the truth? Wouldn't you want to know? Teshin said--"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0370OperatorVoiceB]

"But isn't it better I know the truth? Wouldn't you want to know? Teshin said--"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0380Lotus]
"Teshin thinks he knows better. Maybe he does? Maybe you needed to know to survive the Queens. But you are changed now."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0390OperatorVoiceA]
"That's what you have to say? That I'm 'changed'?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0390OperatorVoiceB]
"That's what you have to say? That I'm 'changed'?"

"What you did. You didn't have a choice. Tenno, you were only just a--"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0392OperatorVoiceA]
"Don't. Don't do that. Don't make excuses for me."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0392OperatorVoiceB]
"Don't. Don't do that. Don't make excuses for me."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0392OperatorVoiceC]
"Don't. Don't do that. Don't make excuses for me."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0392OperatorVoiceD]
"Don't. Don't do that. Don't make excuses for me."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0410Ordis]
"What's this? An Old War beacon? How exciting, Operator. You will want to investigate this… Oh. I'm sorry… did I interrupt?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0420Teshin]
"Tenno, this is one fight your Warframe cannot win."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0430Teshin]
"Remember the mountain. Remember your new strength."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0440Teshin]
"It's time to show the Queens' what they have awoken within you."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0450Teshin]
"Their weapons contain Kuva, it protects them from your Warframe but not from your Tenno powers."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0460Teshin]
"They are protected by the Kuva in their weapons. Find a way to disarm them."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0470Teshin]
"Tenno, remember the Golden Maw and how you brought it to heel."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0480Teshin]
"Let the Guardians feel your Pulse from the Void."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0490Teshin]
"You stunned the Guardian. Dash to strike from within the Void."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0500Teshin]
"They're vulnerable. Attack."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0510Teshin]
"The Guardians protect the braids, the braids protect the Queen."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0520Teshin]
"I can show you no mercy, show me none in return."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0530Teshin]
"Yes! From the moment I began training you, I have anticipated this moment."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0540Teshin]
"You must not stop, defeat me."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0580Teshin]
"You are a child no longer."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0590Teshin]
"I am beaten."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DQueensLairC0600Teshin]
"I… Cannot go… On…"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DSpecterChase0010Lotus]
"Teshin is trying to mask his location from us, but I have pinpointed a suspicious signal for you to investigate. Find him, we need answers."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DSpecterChase0020Lotus]
"All my scans for Teshin have converged on this location. Find him."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DSpecterChase0030Lotus]
"That's not Teshin, it's another one of his Specters. He's trying to shake us off the trail. Capture that Specter, we can use it to find the real Teshin."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DSpecterChase0040Lotus]
"Well done. Return to your ship, I will alert you when I've decrypted this Specter's control signature."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DSpecterChase0050Lotus]
"Teshin's Specter points to what should be an unpopulated asteroid field, but deep scans show the presence of a security-matrix. Someone is trying to hide something, I need you to find out what. Prepare your Archwing."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DTennoNursery0010ElderQueen]
"Bring them to me."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DTennoNursery0020OperatorVoiceA]
"What was that?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DTennoNursery0020OperatorVoiceB]
"What was that?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DTennoNursery0020OperatorVoiceC]
"What was that?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DTennoNursery0020OperatorVoiceD]
"What was that?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DTennoNursery0030Teshin]
"The Queens."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DTennoNursery0040OperatorVoiceA]
"Queens?! The Grineer Queens? Tell me what--"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DTennoNursery0040OperatorVoiceB]
"Queens?! The Grineer Queens? Tell me what--"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DTennoNursery0040OperatorVoiceC]

"Queens?! The Grineer Queens? Tell me what--"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DTennoNursery0050Teshin]
"I am warning you. You think you're safe behind this metal, but you're not. Not in the ways that matter here. Behind this, you're still just a child --"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DTennoNursery0060OperatorVoiceA]
"Stop saying that."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DTennoNursery0060OperatorVoiceB]
"Stop saying that."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DTennoNursery0060OperatorVoiceC]
"Stop saying that."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DTennoNursery0060OperatorVoiceD]
"Stop saying that."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DTennoNursery0070Teshin]
"Follow me again, Tenno, and you will answer to my sword."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DTennoNursery0080Lotus]
"I thought the Queens were just an invention of Grineer command. No one has ever seen them in the flesh."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DTennoNursery0090OperatorVoiceA]
"I have a feeling Teshin has. Can you track him?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DTennoNursery0090OperatorVoiceB]
"I have a feeling Teshin has. Can you track him?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DTennoNursery0090OperatorVoiceC]

"I have a feeling Teshin has. Can you track him?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DTennoNursery0100Lotus]
"Not with Specters masking him. But Tenno, we don't know anything about the Queens. Maybe Teshin alone should--"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DTennoNursery0100OperatorVoiceA]
"No. Teshin's not going to tell me what I can and cannot do. I'll take out his Specters so you can track him."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DTennoNursery0100OperatorVoiceB]
"No. Teshin's not going to tell me what I can and cannot do. I'll take out his Specters so you can track him."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DTennoNursery0110Lotus]
"I have a lock on his route. Exfiltrate when you're ready."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DTennoNursery0130Lotus]
"He's trying to shake us off the trail. Destroy his Specters and keep on him."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DTennoNursery0140OperatorVoiceA]
"Why hasn't he reached out to us? If he is pursuing the Queens, we can help him."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DTennoNursery0140OperatorVoiceB]
"Why hasn't he reached out to us? If he is pursuing the Queens, we can help him."

"Pride or shame, he does seem to have some connection to them."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DTennoNursery0160Lotus]
"Stay on the trail. Finding the Queens could give us a tactical advantage against the Grineer."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DTennoNursery0170OperatorVoiceA]
"Understood."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/TheWarWithin/DTennoNursery0170OperatorVoiceB]

"You've done it Tenno. Vor's Ascaris is gone. You are free now."

"But your work has just begun. The Origin System is in chaos and it needs you, Tenno."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DLisetPostAssassinate080Lotus]
"Vor was just a part of the Grineer machine… and we have seen that the Corpus have begun amassing weapons of their own. It is a dangerous time."

"Oh, no. Operator our component storage has been looted as well..."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DLisetPostFoundry070Ordis]

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DLisetPostNavMod040Lotus]

"Ordis patiently awaits compliance in using the new Arsenal features… it is for the Operators own good."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DLisetPostResRaid240Lotus]
"Oh no. The Ascaris had a tampering failsafe, its burrowed into you and armed itself. We'll need to find Vor before it detonates."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DLisetPostResRaid241Lotus]
"Get to Navigation - boarding a Grineer ship to access their personnel records will be the fastest way to find Vor."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DLisetPostResRaid250Ordis]

"Look at this mess. Those savages! Components have been removed. The lower Orbiter compartments have no life-support. Why did the Operator abandon me?"

"Arsenal management could be restored, if the Operator wishes it."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DOrdis040Ordis]
"You honor Ordis! Now I can supply the Operator with better modded firepower... Oh the violation! Those have been looted as well."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DOrdis050Ordis]

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DOrdis071Lotus]
"Get communications online. I must analyze what Vor's Ascaris is doing to your Warframe. This technology is beyond the Grineer, it must be Corpus in origin."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DOrdis080Ordis]
"Systems engaging. I suppose this will do- Ordis is grateful."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DOrdis090Ordis]
"The Operator is now connected with other Tenno in the system. The Operator may now contact black market scumbags- contact arms-dealers."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DOrdis091Lotus]
"Excellent idea Ordis. Tenno, we need to make contact with a Corpus defector sympathetic to the Tenno cause. They will of course, require compensation."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DOrdis100Ordis]
"You see what Ordis is referring to, Operator?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DOrdis110Lotus]
"In this case compensation will not be credits… it will be freedom. I've updated Navigation. You will need to break him out of a Grineer Gulag."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutAssLeadUp040Vor]
"I could have saved the Grineer but they cast me out. Maybe its not too late to draw your divine blood."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutAssLeadUp050Vor]
"I will put you down like a rabid Kubrow."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutAssObj010Lotus]
"This is our chance. Vor has been stripped of his elite guard, he is vulnerable. Take him out."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutAssObjComplete060Lotus]
"Tenno, look! The Ascaris detonator has just disintegrated, it's as if it was directly connected to Vor. You're done here, go to extraction."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutFoundryObjComplete040Lotus]
"Good, your ship is one step closer to completion."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutFoundryObjComplete041Vor]
"Soon the worm will be in your spine and I will control this Warframe of yours… I will purge your doting mother and bring you home."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutFoundryObjComplete090Lotus]
"You killed the last Grineer. If there are any colonists left, they will know justice has been done for their families. Time for extraction."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutFoundryObjective010Lotus]
"I was afraid of this, the Grineer are here and I cannot find any signs of living colonists. You still have a job to do, find that Foundry Segment."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutFoundryObjective020Lotus]
"You located the Foundry Segment, now pick it up."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutFoundryObjective030Lotus]
"Tenno, you need to pick up the Foundry Segment before we can continue."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutFoundryObjective050Lotus]
"Now there is one more thing you need to do. Eliminate all Grineer and provide justice for the colonists."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutFoundryVorTaunt060Lotus]
"This was once a prosperous independent colony, until the Grineer arrived..."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutFoundryVorTaunt070Vor]

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutFoundryVorTaunt080Lotus]
"Tenno are you there? The signal cannot be boosted any further. Hurry, you are running out of time."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutInterceptContLost060Lotus]
"They've locked me out. Tenno, you'll need to eliminate the Grineer before we can continue."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutInterceptContLost070Lotus]

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutInterceptGetMod080Lotus]

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutInterceptObj010Lotus]

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutInterceptObj011Vor]

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutInterceptObj012Lotus]
"This data-vault is equipped with a variety of security measures. How you defeat those measures is up to you."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutInterceptUseConsole030Lotus]
"Activate the console so I can decouple the Communication Segment we need."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutInterceptUseConsole040Lotus]

"Good work we have what we... wait..."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutNavModChoice060Lotus]
"Tenno, coordinates in this nav segment put the Galleon on a direct course to a convoy of colonists."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutNavModChoice070Lotus]
"You have a choice, you can extract now or you can disable this galleon and save the colonists."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutNavModChoice080Lotus]
"Saving the colonists could jeopardize this mission. I recommend you head straight to extraction but the choice is yours."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutNavModNearObj040Lotus]
"The navigation segment is in the vicinity. Take it."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutNavModObjComp110Lotus]
"You've reached the ships power systems. Destroy the reactor."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutNavModObjComp120Lotus]
"That should take the pressure off the colonist ship but you need to get out of there! Get to extraction before the reactor goes critical."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutNavModObjective010Lotus]
"The systems on this Grineer Galleon can be made compatible with your ship. Find and extract a navigation segment."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutNavModObjective011Vor]
"You have murdered my sons and disgraced me before my Queens. But soon the Ascaris will complete its task and bring you to me."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutNavModVorTaunt090Lotus]

"Quick. Use your power. Defend yourself."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutorial111Vor]
"What? No! Stop that Tenno!"

"Salvage team, why have you not reported in?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutorial210Lotus]
"An extraction ship is on its way but the Grineer will be hunting you. Arm yourself."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutorial230Lotus]
"Quick, choose a weapon."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutorial231Lotus]
"A Tenno's melee weapon honors their warrior tradition. When technology was turned against them, they adapted."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutorial240Lotus]
"A Tenno master respects their enemy, but offers no mercy. You have much to relearn but I will be with you as I am with all Tenno that still live."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutorial260Lotus]
"What was that?"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutorial270Lotus]
"Your Warframe is out of power. Use another weapon."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutorial281Lotus]
"This planet was once a wasteland, abandoned. But now that the air has returned, so have the Grineer."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutorial290Lotus]
"There's a cache of weapons ahead. Grab what you can."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutorial300Lotus]
"With discipline and aim a Tenno's side-arm can strike like a torrent across the battlefield. Choose your weapon."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutorial310Lotus]
"Tenno. Pick up a weapon. You are running out of time."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutorial330Lotus]
"Good. The extraction point is up ahead. Hurry before Vor finds out you've escaped."

"You're not ready to face Vor now. Use your melee weapon to block the beam and get inside."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutorial464Vor]
"My decrepit heart is pounding! This one is stronger than the rest. Lock the area down! This Tenno is mine!"

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutorial465Lotus]
"There's an energy signal in the ruins nearby, it may be our only chance but we need to release the lockdown. Search the wreckage - you should find a cipher."

[/Lotus/Language/Subtitles/VorsPrize/DTutorial466Lotus]
"You need to avoid Vor's beam, or divert it with your melee weapon, Tenno!"
